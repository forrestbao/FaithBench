"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years."," In the'mini-derby', Manchester United's Under 18s defeated City's Under 18s 1-0.

"Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance. Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies. The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge. The win lifted Mick McCarthy's Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: ""The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three. ""With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team. ""We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been."" QPR boss Ian Holloway:  ""I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn't have. ""The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five. ""Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him. Even with my legs, I would have ran back and tried to help him. ""My players need to be mentally tougher as a group. I am disappointed with how we finished today.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said.

During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not ""made any physical changes or enhancements"" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage. The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had ""only drunk a can and a half of Foster's"" and clearly recollected the events.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park. The fourth-tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday, but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian. Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross.

Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. ""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early."," In the provided passage, a hospital in Afghanistan was attacked by militants armed with guns and grenades, who gained entry by detonating explosives at the hospital gate and opening fire on staff and patients.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game.

Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead.

Dagenham had initially reached the Football League for the first time in 2007, and under manager John Still, they had climbed from the Conference to League One. However, this season, they have the worst goal difference in League Two, having conceded 20 more goals than at the same point last season. In attack, 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton has scored nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored during the 2014-15 season when Dagenham finished 14th.

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews."," Adrian Gill, a renowned journalist and published author, passed away due to cancer.

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. ""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: ""We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. ""The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably."""," In the cricket match between Yorkshire and Surrey, Surrey posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Foakes (90) contributing a stand of 130.

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders."""," The passage discusses funding decisions for Olympic and Paralympic sports in the UK for the Tokyo 2020 Games.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books.""

"Media playback is not supported on this device Benteke becomes the Reds' second most expensive signing, on what the club describe as a ""long-term contract"". Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool].

"The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place. But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. ""Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,"" she said. ""We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. ""It would be more heartbreak than humiliation."" Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. ""Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,"" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. ""It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. ""I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead."" With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. ""Iceland are top seeds in the group,"" Evans noted. ""They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. ""But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. ""It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference."" Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. ""It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,"" she recalled. ""There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. ""We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. ""I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us."" Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. ""Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,"" she added. ""The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. ""Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. ""The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. ""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future."," Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, announced an unexpected one-year extension of his term, which was set to end in 2018.

In 2018, one of his daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. He felt that this extension would allow him to return home to Canada and its renowned education system at an appropriate time for his family. The extension was not influenced by political pressure, Brexit-related economic predictions, or any tension with the Prime Minister, Theresa May.

"rory mcilroy believes it is ` unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam .
and the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at augusta national in 2011 was the most important day of his career .
mcilroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus and tiger woods .
rory mcilroy tees off at the arnold palmer invitational golf tournament in orlando on march 19
` for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland .
` there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year .
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions .
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome .
it would just be incredible .
` you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much .
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . '
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round .
mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month
but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket .
` during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added .
` if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time .
if i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed .
` and not just one .
i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on .
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . '
mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel .
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year .
mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added .
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much .
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot .
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position .
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out .
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . '

by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .

in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 2012 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980

june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","he passage describes the sixth significant fight in boxing history, Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao, which is anticipated to be the most financially successful and significant fight of the century. The summary focuses on the Sugar Ray Leonard vs Roberto Duran trilogy, considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middleweights.

In their first fight, Duran outpointed Leonard in Montreal, leading to a controversial result. In the second fight, Leonard used his speed and movement to frustrate Duran, who eventually quit in the eighth round, saying ""no mas."" This event was met with shock and disbelief, as Duran was known for his heroic and tough fighting style. It took Duran three years to rebuild his reputation, which he did by knocking out Davey Moore in 1983 to win the world light-middleweight title.

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '

born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .

while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '

the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '

born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-13 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.

"have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door , been woken by a facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger ?
to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products .
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )
losing your keys ( 37 per cent )
being stuck in traffic when already late ( 35 per cent )
losing an important paper or document ( 33 per cent )
nowhere to park ( 32 per cent )
printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .

of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .
and as another solution to your phone running out of battery , one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies .
products that did n't make the final shortlist included the parking pin , shown .

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him .

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years."," Manchester United's Under 18s defeated City 1-0 in a'mini-derby' match, with Callum Gribbin scoring the winning goal.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up.

The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship.

Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

"The magnitude-4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) 35km north of the city of Lucca, officials said. The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"".

At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early."," Militants armed with guns and grenades attacked a hospital in Afghanistan, killing all four attackers after a two-hour standoff with commandos. The attack, claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, resulted in over 50 injuries. The hospital attack marks a shift in IS's approach, engaging directly with security forces in the capital for the first time. Previously, IS mainly targeted civilian gatherings and rival Taliban forces in the east. The attack highlights the potential for more such assaults in the future, as IS appears to be expanding its attacks and resources. The Taliban has denied involvement in the attack.

The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT) when an attacker wearing a white coat and carrying a Kalashnikov opened fire on hospital staff, patients, and guards. The attacker's entry was facilitated by detonating explosives at the hospital gate. The Afghan government claims to have rooted out IS militants from bases in the east but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation. ""After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future. ""We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.""

Sam Clucas then made a remarkable goalline clearance in the final minute of added time. The win ended Hull City's six-game losing streak and placed them in the bottom three, but it was a significant morale boost for the team.

Southampton's Charlie Austin scored the winning goal in the 61st minute, following a well-taken assist from Dawson. The match saw a shift in Hull City's performance after the introduction of Snodgrass, who provided the team with renewed energy and determination.

The game was marked by a lack of urgency from Hull City in the first half, with Southampton taking control and creating opportunities. However, Hull City managed to respond in the second half, with goals from Austin and Clucas. Despite the late equalizer from Austin, Southampton's victory was a significant achievement for the team.

"The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role.

At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club. ""We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs."" Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: ""I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline.

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac.

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. ""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: ""We are all gutted.

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Benteke becomes the Reds' second most expensive signing, on what the club describe as a ""long-term contract"". Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad.

"The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place. But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. ""Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,"" she said. ""We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. ""It would be more heartbreak than humiliation."" Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. ""Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,"" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. ""It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. ""I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead."" With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off.

Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. ""It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,"" she recalled. ""There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. ""We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. ""I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us."" Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. ""Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,"" she added. ""The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. ""Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future."," Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing a one-year extension to his term in 2018, instead of the originally planned departure in 2018 or the full eight-year term. This decision was influenced by personal reasons, including his family's education plans and his desire to give his full attention and devotion to the role. The extension was seen as a way to provide stability during the Brexit negotiations, which were expected to begin in 2018. Carney's decision was not influenced by political pressure or criticism of the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts. The extension allows Carney to leave the UK in 2019, after the Brexit negotiations are complete, and a new Governor will take over to plot Britain's economic future.",microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct,0.91113,0.25472,0.16491,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.92419,1,0,0,1

by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .

in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .

that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .

i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .

the care assistant , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .

"pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . '
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .
ilze zebolde , 31 , takes in her surrounds as she and pablo mandado take a break in their cycle journey around the world

ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of

pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world
` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says .
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .
finally going further away and into the unknown . '
they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '
` we are going to be on the road for the following years , ' they say ."," Pablo Mandado and Ilze Zebolde, a couple from Riga, Latvia and Spain respectively, embarked on a year-long cycling journey around the world in 2011.

it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .

any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .

spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him .

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.","Here's a concise summary of the passage:

The Manchester United Under 18s team defeated Manchester City 1-0 in a 'mini-derby' match. The game was played at Altrincham's Moss Lane stadium, with free entry and about 1,000 spectators. Unlike the senior derby, this match featured mostly English players, with many being local Mancunians. Callum Gribbin scored the winning goal for United with a free-kick. United's coach, Paul McGuinness, set up the team in a formation similar to the first team to give players experience. The match was competitive, with chances for both sides. The result leaves United two points behind league leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand, while City has lost both matches in the end-of-season play-off series.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

The passage describes three main hacking groups involved in the Ukraine-Russia conflict:

1. Ukrainian Cyber Troops: Led by Yevhen Dokukin, they hack Russian servers, conduct DDoS attacks on rebel websites, disrupt separatist funding, and monitor CCTV systems in rebel-held areas. They claim to provide information to Ukrainian security services.

2. Cyber Berkut: A pro-Russian group that targets Ukrainian government websites, leaks confidential documents, and spreads anti-Western propaganda. They've hacked electronic billboards and claim to have disrupted Ukraine's electronic voting systems.

3. Anonymous International: A Russian activist group that leaks documents from the Kremlin, including some related to the Ukraine conflict.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time.

West Ham United defeated Cheltenham Town 2-0 in an EFL Cup match. The Premier League side took control with two quick first-half goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew. Cheltenham, a League Two team, had a bright start but couldn't sufficiently test West Ham's goalkeeper. The hosts had a few chances, including Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header, but couldn't convert. West Ham could have increased their lead, with James Collins and Sam Byram missing opportunities.

Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. ""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","Here's a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information:

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game.

Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","Here's a concise summary of the passage:

Adrian Gill, a renowned columnist for the Sunday Times, passed away after being diagnosed with multiple cancers. Known for his witty, dazzling, and fearless writing style, Gill was a highly respected and controversial figure in journalism. He had been with the Sunday Times since 1993 and was described as the ""heart and soul"" of the paper. Despite his illness, Gill remained stoical and continued writing until the end. His final column about his diagnosis will be published posthumously. 

Gill's career spanned decades, during which he overcame dyslexia and became known for his distinctive writing style. He often caused controversy with his sharp critiques and provocative comments. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had a background in art before turning to writing. He was married twice, including to current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, and had four children. At the time of his death, he was engaged to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby.

Many colleagues and fellow journalists paid tribute to Gill, praising his unique voice and significant impact on the field of journalism.",Anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620,0.67293,0.05623,0.01849,0,0.0,1,1,1,0.56455,0,1,1,1
"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. ""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: ""We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. ""The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably.""","Here's a concise summary of the passage:

Surrey defeated Yorkshire in a cricket match, advancing to the final at Lord's. Surrey initially struggled at 8-2 but recovered to post 255-7, thanks to a 130-run partnership between Davies and Foakes. Yorkshire's chase was disrupted by Stuart Meaker's three quick wickets, including key players Bairstow and Ballance. Despite Bresnan's 68, Yorkshire fell short, all out for 236. Yorkshire had hoped to reach Lord's for the first time since 2002 after a recent T20 Blast semi-final loss.

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.""","Here's a concise summary of the passage:

UK Sport has announced funding decisions for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, with a total investment of £345m across 31 sports. This is £2m less than the funding for Rio 2016. Some sports, including badminton, archery, fencing, weightlifting, and wheelchair rugby, have had their funding cut or removed entirely. Cycling has seen a significant reduction in funding. The decision has been met with criticism from affected sports, particularly badminton, which won a bronze medal in Rio. UK Sport defends its decisions, stating the need to prioritize medal potential. The funding body has set medal targets for Team GB in Tokyo: 51-85 Olympic medals and 115-162 Paralympic medals.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either.

I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League.

Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. ""It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,"" she recalled. ""There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. ""We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. ""I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us."" Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. ""Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,"" she added. ""The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. ""Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. ""The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. ""It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.""","Here's a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information:

The Scottish women's national football team is close to qualifying for their first major tournament, the Euro 2017 finals in the Netherlands. They have won all five qualifiers so far and are set to host Iceland in a crucial match. Forward Lisa Evans emphasizes the importance of qualifying, given past disappointments in play-offs. Iceland is their main rival in the group, also unbeaten. Scotland is well-positioned to qualify automatically, either by topping the group or as one of the best runners-up. The team benefits from having 12 players competing in top leagues outside Scotland, including Evans, who recently won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich. Evans believes the experience gained by players abroad contributes significantly to the national team's improvement and current success.",Anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620,0.29643,0.53035,0.77672,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.80993,1,0,1,1
"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. ""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

"Tries from Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van and Chris Bridge gave Widnes a 14-6 half-time lead, with Cas loanee Paddy Flynn responding against his parent club. Flynn scored another early in the second, but Ah Van, Lloyd White (2) and Joe Mellor tries made it 38-12. Despite three Cas tries in four minutes - Larne Patrick, Luke Gale and Flynn's hat-trick score - Widnes held on. The Vikings' victory had looked assured when Mellor took advantage of Castleford indecision on a short kick-off, running straight through to help them to a 26-point lead. But, having lost nine of their previous 10 matches, their defence creaked as they let Patrick, who has just signed a three-year deal to move from Huddersfield after his loan spell, in for a try. Gale and Flynn - on loan at Castleford from the Vikings until the end of the season - made it a nervy finish, but the Tigers suffered their fourth consecutive home league defeat.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Here's a concise summary of the passage:

Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing a one-year extension to his term, rather than staying until 2021 or leaving in 2018 as originally planned. This decision was primarily driven by personal reasons, particularly his family's needs. Carney's extension to 2019 allows him to oversee the initial Brexit negotiations while also accommodating his daughters' education plans. The passage emphasizes that this was a personal decision, not influenced by political pressure or criticism of the Bank's economic forecasts. Carney felt it was important not to leave during the Brexit negotiations but also wanted to return to Canada with his family in 2018.

` for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland .
` there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year .
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions .
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome .
it would just be incredible .
` you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much .
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . '
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round .
mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month
but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket .
` during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added .
` if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time .
if i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed .
` and not just one .
i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on .
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . '
mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel .
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year .
mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added .
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much .
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot .
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position .
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out .
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . '
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february .
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to caroline wozniacki
and he hopes he can again use the golf course as his ` sanctuary ' from the pressure and hype surrounding augusta .
` the golf course was my sanctuary , it was where i could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that i am out there and it helped .
it really did , ' he added .
` i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen .
` i know i wo n't be able to wait until thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the golf course and play golf .

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight

july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 2012 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight

june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","Here's a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information:

judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .

all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Here's a concise summary of the key information from the passage:

Leonie Granger, a 25-year-old aspiring model, has been jailed for 16 years for her role in the death of Mehmet Hassan, a 56-year-old professional gambler. Granger targeted Hassan at a London casino, befriending him and gaining his trust. She later lured him to his flat, where her boyfriend Kyrron Jackson and accomplice Nicholas Chandler entered, tied up Hassan, and beat him to death while searching for his gambling winnings. Jackson and Chandler were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 36 years. The judge described the attack as ""pitiless and wicked."" The trio stole £3,000, a TV, and a mobile phone from Hassan's flat. They were caught after police examined Granger's phone records.

` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .

born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .

speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .

in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .

to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .

any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .

the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .
van gaal is already familiar with the qualities of depay having named him in his 23-man world cup squad last year as holland finished third in brazil .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .

psv eindhoven won there first eredivisie title in seven years after beating heerenveen 4-1 on saturday
depay ( right ) celebrates the dutch giants ' success with manager phillip cocu after the match
born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-13 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.

A company called Direct Line is running a competition called #everydayfix to address common everyday problems. They surveyed 2,000 people to identify top ""everyday emergencies"" and asked design groups to create prototype solutions. Three finalists were chosen:

1. Snooze: An alarm clock that silences phone notifications for better sleep.
2. Forget Me Lock: A device that attaches to keys and shows if a door is locked or unlocked.
3. Nipper: A small mobile phone charger that uses household batteries.

People can vote for their favorite product on Twitter, and the winner will be funded through a Kickstarter campaign and developed into an actual product. Other interesting prototypes that didn't make the final cut include a smart cycling helmet with navigation, a parking space finder, and an app to redirect messages when your phone dies.

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .
granger 's co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , ( left ) and nicholas chandler , 29 , ( right ) , both from south east london , have both been convicted of murdering mr hassan and are to be sentenced in due course

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Here's a concise summary of the key information from the passage:

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.","In a match between the Under 18s of Manchester United and Manchester City, United won 1-0 thanks to a free-kick from Callum Gribbin.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

"The magnitude-4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) 35km north of the city of Lucca, officials said. The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement. The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory"" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake. At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely. On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.","A 4.8-magnitude earthquake hit central Italy, causing widespread tremors but no reported injuries or damage. The quake's epicentre was in Garfagnana, north of Lucca, and its shallow depth led to its impact being felt across a large area, including major cities like Milan, Florence, Bologna, and Modena. This event highlights Italy's seismic vulnerability, with a history of devastating earthquakes, including the 2009 L'Aquila quake that killed almost 300 people. The recent tremor caught experts by surprise, emphasising the challenges in predicting and managing earthquake risks, especially after the controversial convictions of scientists for their role in the 2009 disaster.",cohere/command-r-08-2024,0.99543,0.45914,0.5642,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.85721,1,1,1,1

She will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody and said it was likely she would be held at a male prison. He added: ""If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason.

During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not ""made any physical changes or enhancements"" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage. The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had ""only drunk a can and a half of Foster's"" and clearly recollected the events.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park. The fourth-tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday, but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian. Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross.

Media playback is not supported on this device Murray looked like avoiding a long, drawn-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded. Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. ""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","Militants from the Islamic State (IS) group carried out a deadly attack on a hospital in Afghanistan, killing and wounding many.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.""

"The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role. Leyton Orient interim manager Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device ""For me to lose two managers this season has been very tough and I've found it very hard this week. ""We had to be professional, we're here to do a job and if I wasn't professional then I wouldn't be true to myself. ""We owe it to the fans. At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club. ""We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs."" Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: ""I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline. ""If you haven't got organisation and you haven't got the discipline to play 90 minutes, the outcome is inevitable. ""Dagenham over the years are going to get beat, it's responding to that that the club's not been able to do this year.""","The passage describes a crucial football match between Dagenham & Redbridge (The Daggers) and Leyton Orient (The O's) with significant implications for both teams. Dagenham, facing relegation, needed a win to maintain their League Two status, while Orient aimed to secure a play-off spot. The game saw a thrilling comeback from Dagenham, who initially conceded two goals but fought back to level the score. However, Armand Gnanduillet's winner for Orient sealed Dagenham's fate, relegating them to the National League. This result highlights Dagenham's struggles throughout the season, with a poor goal difference and a less productive attack compared to previous years. Despite the setback, Dagenham's manager, John Still, expressed his commitment to leading the team back to promotion next season. Meanwhile, Orient's interim manager, Andy Hessenthaler, acknowledged the challenges of losing two managers in a season but emphasized the team's professionalism and dedication to winning for their fans.",cohere/command-r-08-2024,0.71656,0.67377,0.89349,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.9135,0,1,1,1

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","Adrian Gill, a renowned columnist and author, passed away after a battle with cancer.

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. ""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: ""We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. ""The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably.""","The match saw a strong performance from Surrey, who posted an impressive score of 255-7 after an early setback, thanks to a crucial partnership between Davies and Foakes. Yorkshire's run-chase was hindered by Stuart Meaker's three-wicket burst, which included key wickets. Despite a fighting effort from Tim Bresnan and Matthew Waite, Yorkshire fell short, all out for 236. Surrey's captain, Gareth Batty, praised his team's performance, highlighting the impact of the Davies-Foakes partnership. Yorkshire's captain, Alex Lees, expressed disappointment, acknowledging their bowlers' efforts but lamenting the lack of substantial contributions from their top-order batters.",cohere/command-r-08-2024,0.77314,0.68691,0.86435,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.89204,1,1,1,1
"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.""","The UK government and National Lottery have committed funding for 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports, totalling £345 million, with the aim of maintaining Britain's success at the Tokyo 2020 Games. This is a slight decrease from the previous funding allocation for Rio. Cycling, despite its strong medal performance in Rio, has seen a funding cut. Badminton, however, has had its funding removed entirely, despite winning a medal in Rio, with its representatives expressing shock and disappointment.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Benteke becomes the Reds' second most expensive signing, on what the club describe as a ""long-term contract"". Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad. ""I'm a lot more optimistic than I was this time last year. The strikers only scored eight goals last year, we can only do better than that going forward.""

The Belgian international striker, known for his physical presence and goal-scoring ability, is expected to bolster Liverpool's attack after a disappointing season.

"The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place. But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. ""Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,"" she said. ""We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. ""It would be more heartbreak than humiliation."" Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. ""Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,"" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. ""It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. ""I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead."" With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. ""Iceland are top seeds in the group,"" Evans noted. ""They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. ""But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. ""It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference."" Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. ""It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,"" she recalled. ""There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. ""We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. ""I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us."" Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. ""Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,"" she added. ""The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. ""Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. ""The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. ""It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.""","The Scottish women's football team is on the cusp of qualifying for a major tournament, having won all five qualifiers so far. A win against Iceland, who are also unbeaten, would almost guarantee their spot in the finals. This is a significant opportunity for the team, having narrowly missed out on previous tournaments.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. ""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing a one-year extension to his term, rather than the expected options of staying until 2021 or leaving in 2018. This decision was influenced by personal factors, particularly his family's situation, as his daughters will be completing important exams in 2018, and the family wishes to return to Canada for its education system. The Brexit vote also complicated matters, as leaving in 2018 would coincide with Britain's exit negotiations, but a longer extension was not feasible due to family considerations.

` for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland .
` there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year .
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions .
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome .
it would just be incredible .
` you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much .
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . '
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round .
mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month
but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket .
` during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added .
` if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time .
if i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed .
` and not just one .
i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on .
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . '
mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel .
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year .
mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added .
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much .
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot .
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position .
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out .
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . '
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february .
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to caroline wozniacki
and he hopes he can again use the golf course as his ` sanctuary ' from the pressure and hype surrounding augusta .
` the golf course was my sanctuary , it was where i could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that i am out there and it helped .
it really did , ' he added .
` i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen .
` i know i wo n't be able to wait until thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the golf course and play golf .
there is only so much you can talk about it and then you have to go out and try and play .

the posters are now being removed from the london underground
a tfl spokesperson told mailonline : ` this advertisement will begin to be removed from our network as scheduled from tomorrow .
` we have received one complaint about it and we will be guided by the committee of advertising practice ( cap ) and advertising standards authority ( asa ) if a similar advert were to be submitted again .
` we have zero tolerance towards graffiti on the network and take action to prevent it and remove it . '
the removal of the posters comes as a protest organised against protein world in hyde park on may 2 gathers steam - hundreds of people are expected to attend the rally in central london .
the posters have caused a huge backlash on social media , with thousands of tweets directed at the campaign .
one user called catrin stewartwrite : ` you clearly know what you 're trying to sell with that offensive , unrealistic and sexist advert . '

the tv stars also addressed the company 's blunt responses to twitter complaints , including ` why make your insecurities our problem ' and ` grow up ' .
but staveley believes the reaction is justified , saying , ` there is an irrational minority who have decided to interpret it in that way . '
susanna , 44 , retorted : ` do you think everybody who objects to it is irrational ?
am i an irrational extremist ? '
defending protein world : richard staveley , head of global marketing , insisted the company 's advert was n't meant to offend and was targeted at health-conscious individuals looking to get fit in time for summer

"floyd mayweather v manny pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century .
evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political , social and cultural undertones , the scale of expectation and outside influences .
where money man v pacman comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the mgm grand garden arena .
in this , the sixth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history , i recall when a hard man could take no more ...
sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 2012 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out .

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .

about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

Binge drinking rates rose faster for women than men, with a 36% increase in Santa Clara County, California, compared to 23% for men.

both homes will need to be modernised , with the second , larger property - also on egerton place - on the market for £ 595,000 .

` we have had interest from locals , developers and end users .
in modernised condition , we would estimate they would sell for between £ 2,750 and £ 3,000 per sq/ft . '
this gives the smaller property a £ 6 million prices tag , while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £ 7.5 million .
the current freeholder is thought to be the welcome trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and , for a 90-year lease , it is likely to cost between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million .
egerton place was built off michael 's grove by john grover and son to the designs of architect mervyn macartney around 1893 .
the properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the egerton gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets , finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange .

leases of all the homes were granted by the smith 's charity trustees in 1894 , and its first occupant was , sir evan macgregor , permanent secretary to the admiralty .
other residents of high status included the dowager lady lawrence , probably the widow of the first baron lawrence , at no. 5 , and sir henry fielding dickens , q.c. , son of the novelist charles at no. 2 .

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out .

granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .

all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .

"manchester united have ramped up their efforts to sign psv eindhoven star memphis depay by making an official approach for the 21-year-old .
the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .
van gaal is already familiar with the qualities of depay having named him in his 23-man world cup squad last year as holland finished third in brazil .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .

the 21-year-old took his tally to 20 on saturday psv eindhoven beat heerenveen 4-1 to win the dutch championship on saturday for the first time in seven seasons .
the dutch league 's leading scorer doubled the hosts ' lead midway through the first half with a stunning free kick after luuk de jong headed them ahead early on .
heerenveen midfielder joey van den berg pulled a goal back for his side before de jong restored the two-goal advantage just before half-time and luciano narsingh added a fourth late on .
it is a 22nd league championship for psv , who are second only to ajax ( 33 titles ) in holland .
psv eindhoven won there first eredivisie title in seven years after beating heerenveen 4-1 on saturday
depay ( right ) celebrates the dutch giants ' success with manager phillip cocu after the match
born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-20 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.
having impressed in brazil , depay was nominated for the tournament 's ` best young player ' award but lost out to france midfielder paul pogba .

and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .

in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .

pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .

leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )
losing your keys ( 37 per cent )
being stuck in traffic when already late ( 35 per cent )
losing an important paper or document ( 33 per cent )
nowhere to park ( 32 per cent )
printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost

of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .
and as another solution to your phone running out of battery , one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies .

"manchester united have ramped up their efforts to sign psv eindhoven star memphis depay by making an official approach for the 21-year-old .
the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .
van gaal is already familiar with the qualities of depay having named him in his 23-man world cup squad last year as holland finished third in brazil .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .

the 21-year-old took his tally to 20 on saturday psv eindhoven beat heerenveen 4-1 to win the dutch championship on saturday for the first time in seven seasons .
the dutch league 's leading scorer doubled the hosts ' lead midway through the first half with a stunning free kick after luuk de jong headed them ahead early on .
heerenveen midfielder joey van den berg pulled a goal back for his side before de jong restored the two-goal advantage just before half-time and luciano narsingh added a fourth late on .
it is a 22nd league championship for psv , who are second only to ajax ( 33 titles ) in holland .

depay ( right ) celebrates the dutch giants ' success with manager phillip cocu after the match
born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-13 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.

"pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . '
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .

ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .

forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.","The passage describes a youth football match between Manchester United's Under 18s and Manchester City's Under 18s, which United won 1-0.

""The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five. ""Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.

James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The Briton, 30, won 6-2 4-6 6-1 7-5 after two hours and 39 minutes, with match point clinched at 20:57 BST. Fognini, the 29th seed, had five set points to force a fifth set but Murray won five games in a row to seal a place in the last 16 for the 11th time. Murray will play Frenchman Benoit Paire in the fourth round on Monday. Fellow Briton Johanna Konta earlier reached the second week for the first time with a 6-4 6-1 win over Maria Sakkari of Greece. Media playback is not supported on this device ""The end of the match was tense. It was an up and down match. I didn't feel like it was the best tennis at times but I managed to get through,"" Murray told the BBC. ""It was getting dark towards the end and I was probably thinking a bit about that. ""We would have had to go off for the roof to go on, so that would have meant a change in conditions. I'm pleased to get off in four."" Media playback is not supported on this device Murray looked like avoiding a long, drawn-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded. Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. ""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday. ""I'm happy to get through the first week and anything can happen from here on.""","Andy Murray, 30, won his match against Fognini, 29, in four sets (6-2, 4-6, 6-1, 7-5) after a tense and dramatic final set. Despite having five set points, Fognini could not secure a fifth set due to poor lighting conditions. Murray will next face Benoit Paire in the fourth round.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","The passage describes a militant attack on Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, where attackers entered by detonating explosives at the gate and engaging in gunfire. The attack lasted several hours and resulted in the deaths of all four attackers, with over 50 others wounded. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility, marking a shift in their tactics from targeting civilians to engaging directly with security forces. The attack highlights IS's growing capabilities and potential for more assaults. The government has previously struggled to root out IS militants, particularly in eastern regions.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The hosts won with a day to spare at Old Trafford to level the series.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation. ""After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future. ""We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.""

"The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead.

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers.

Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included.

Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","Adrian Gill, a renowned journalist and writer for the Sunday Times, passed away after battling various cancers. Known for his distinctive writing style and controversial opinions, Gill joined the newspaper in 1993 and became a significant figure in its history. Despite facing health challenges, he maintained a positive outlook and continued working until his death. Tributes from colleagues praised his wit, intelligence, and compassionate nature. Gill's career was marked by both acclaim and controversy, with his writings often provoking strong reactions.

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. ""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: ""We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. ""The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably.""","Yorkshire attempted to chase a score set by Surrey but were unsuccessful, ending with 236 all out. Surrey's innings featured a significant partnership between Davies and Ben Foakes, which was crucial in setting the target. Yorkshire's run-chase was hampered by a quick three-wicket spell from Stuart Meaker, including dismissals of key players like Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Despite efforts from Tim Bresnan and Matthew Waite, Yorkshire fell short. The match was part of a larger context where Yorkshire aimed to reach Lord's for the first time since 2002, following a loss in the T20 Blast semi-finals. Both teams' captains reflected on the game, with Surrey's captain praising the team's performance and Yorkshire's captain expressing disappointment in their inability to convert their strong performances into victories under pressure.",Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct,0.92603,0.72593,0.83997,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.79146,0,1,1,1
"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.""","The passage discusses funding cuts for certain Olympic and Paralympic sports in preparation for the Tokyo 2020 Games. Key points include:

- Funding reductions for archery, fencing, weightlifting, and wheelchair rugby.
- Cycling's funding cut by over £4 million to £25.98 million.
- Badminton's funding completely removed despite achieving a bronze medal in Rio.
- Total investment reduced to £345 million, £2 million less than Rio's record £347 million.
- UK Sport targets 51-85 Olympic medals and 115-162 Paralympic medals for Tokyo.
- Some sports, like judo, received slight funding increases.
- UK Sport justifies cuts by prioritizing medal potential and protecting overall performance.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Benteke becomes the Reds' second most expensive signing, on what the club describe as a ""long-term contract"". Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. ""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, announced he would extend his tenure by one year instead of leaving in 2018 as originally planned. This decision was influenced by personal reasons, specifically his daughters' educational needs. Carney intended to return to Canada after his daughter's A-levels and GCSEs were completed. He emphasized that his decision was based on personal circumstances and not political pressure.

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 2012 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out .

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .
kaiser health news ( khn ) is a nonprofit national health policy news service .","The study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found that heavy drinking among Americans increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, with the rise largely attributed to women. Binge drinking also increased, with women's rates rising significantly faster than men's. The study tracked these trends at the county level and noted that while the percentage of people drinking alcohol remained stable, the rates of heavy drinking and binge drinking increased. Factors contributing to this trend include changing social norms, increased affordability of alcohol, and more aggressive alcohol advertising. Public health experts suggest that these changes have led to more acceptable and frequent binge drinking, especially among women.",Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct,0.55279,0.96959,0.99367,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.95408,0,0,1,1

it is one of two maisonettes being sold with three years remaining on the lease .
both homes will need to be modernised , with the second , larger property - also on egerton place - on the market for £ 595,000 .
the next cheapest three-bedroom property in knightsbridge costs £ 1.5 million , and this flat is only offered with a 28-year lease .
but the property comes with a catch , not only is it in dire need of renovation , ( such as in one of its bedrooms , pictured ) the home has just three years left on the lease
the cost for £ 575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area , plus renovation works which are needed , such as in the living room ( pictured )
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space , could be worth upwards of £ 6 million
jake russell , from russell simpson , said : ` properties like this come up once in a blue moon and i think it is an outstanding opportunity .
` to get properties like this in egerton place is very exciting and the phone has n't stopped ringing , which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner .
` we have had interest from locals , developers and end users .
in modernised condition , we would estimate they would sell for between £ 2,750 and £ 3,000 per sq/ft . '
this gives the smaller property a £ 6 million prices tag , while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £ 7.5 million .
the current freeholder is thought to be the welcome trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and , for a 90-year lease , it is likely to cost between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million .
egerton place was built off michael 's grove by john grover and son to the designs of architect mervyn macartney around 1893 .
the properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the egerton gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets , finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange .
estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone ` has n't stopped ringing ' about the egerton place apartment
but alex newall , from hanover private office , had a warning to potential buyers : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease '
leases of all the homes were granted by the smith 's charity trustees in 1894 , and its first occupant was , sir evan macgregor , permanent secretary to the admiralty .
other residents of high status included the dowager lady lawrence , probably the widow of the first baron lawrence , at no. 5 , and sir henry fielding dickens , q.c. , son of the novelist charles at no. 2 .
one property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases .
alex newall , from hanover private office , said : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease .
` a developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder .
` it is a very quirky situation .
properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like knightsbridge .
` i know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought ` right , i need to extend it ' , but by then it was too late and the extension was too much .
` let it be a warning to check your lease . '","A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, listed for £575,000, has only three years left on its lease. This price is significantly lower than neighboring properties, making it seem like a bargain. However, the property requires extensive renovation and the lease extension would cost millions, potentially making the total value of the property upwards of £6 million if extended. The smaller property is described as needing modernization and having 1,990 sq/ft of space, while the larger one, priced at £595,000, has 2,500 sq/ft.

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .

"pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . '
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .
ilze zebolde , 31 , takes in her surrounds as she and pablo mandado take a break in their cycle journey around the world

ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of

pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world
` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says .
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .
finally going further away and into the unknown . '
they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '

to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products .
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .

discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about

of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .

and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .

with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .

leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )
losing your keys ( 37 per cent )

losing an important paper or document ( 33 per cent )
nowhere to park ( 32 per cent )
printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about

of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .
granger 's co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , ( left ) and nicholas chandler , 29 , ( right ) , both from south east london , have both been convicted of murdering mr hassan and are to be sentenced in due course

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him .

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

They use distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and have also hacked into public CCTV systems to monitor troop movements. Other groups, such as Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International, also operate in the conflict, with differing goals and methods.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement. The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory"" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake. At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.

Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.""

Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season.

In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him.""

Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced.

Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining.

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.""","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

UK Sport has allocated £345m to 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports for the Tokyo 2020 Games, a decrease of £2m from the Rio 2016 Games. The investment will target 51-85 Olympic medals and 115-162 Paralympic medals. Badminton, which won a bronze medal in Rio, has had its funding cut, while judo has had its funding increased slightly. UK Sport's chair, Rod Carr, says the funding decisions are critical for sports to maintain their historic success at Rio. The decision to cut funding for badminton has been met with criticism from the sport's leaders, who say it will have a catastrophic impact on the sport. UK Sport says it must prioritize sports with the highest medal potential, but has left the door open for other sports, including baseball, which will return to the Olympic programme after a 13-year absence.",meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,0.47689,0.12963,0.00814,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.41931,1,0,1,1

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books.""

Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner.

Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

Carney stated that his decision was entirely personal and not related to government policy, and that he wanted to devote his full attention to the role for as long as he could.

that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 2012 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .
the care assistant , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .

born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '

and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .

ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of

the view from pablo and ilze 's tent as they awake to another day in the saddle as they live out their dream
pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world
` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says .
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .
finally going further away and into the unknown . '
they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '

"have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door , been woken by a facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger ?
to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products .
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )
losing your keys ( 37 per cent )

printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called snooze , shown , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep
whichever tweet has the most retweets , with the #everydayfix hashtag , by 46 april will go into a kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development .

of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .
and as another solution to your phone running out of battery , one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies .
products that did n't make the final shortlist included the parking pin , shown .

the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '

depay ( right ) celebrates the dutch giants ' success with manager phillip cocu after the match
born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-13 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.

latvian ilze sets up camp , the most common means of accommodation for her and pablo , on the stunning lake bled in slovenia
ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of
pablo and ilze 's tent in a field in bosnia - this is their usual means of accommodation although they often use hosting websites
pabo and ilze take a break in an italian mountain town as they work their way from france towards eastern europe
pablo rides along the waterside in thessaloniki , greece , one of more than 222 stops they 've made in their journey so far
all landscapes and settings are greeting pablo and ilze , including moody forests in france as they rode along both coasts
ilze rides into the clouds as pedal power takes her and pablo through eastern europe and towards asia , their next continent
the view from pablo and ilze 's tent as they awake to another day in the saddle as they live out their dream
pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world
` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says .
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .
finally going further away and into the unknown . '
they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '
` we are going to be on the road for the following years , ' they say .","Here is a concise summary of the passage:

Pablo Mandado (27) and Ilze Zebolde (31) are a couple on an open-ended cycling journey around the world. They met in 2011 and quit their restaurant jobs in Manchester to embark on their adventure.

"have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door , been woken by a facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger ?
to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products .
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )
losing your keys ( 37 per cent )
being stuck in traffic when already late ( 35 per cent )
losing an important paper or document ( 33 per cent )
nowhere to park ( 32 per cent )
printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called snooze , shown , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep
whichever tweet has the most retweets , with the #everydayfix hashtag , by 40 april will go into a kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development .
` we 've seen the great british designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies , ' said paul smyth , co-founder of makerversity .
` through the direct line everyday fix event , we 've been able to extend our role as "" fixers "" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation 's everyday emergencies , ' added john shaw , head of r&d and innovation at direct line .
of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .
and as another solution to your phone running out of battery , one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies .
products that did n't make the final shortlist included the parking pin , shown .
you could leave this in a parking space , and it will alert you when the space is free , so you can park your car

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .
granger 's co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , ( left ) and nicholas chandler , 29 , ( right ) , both from south east london , have both been convicted of murdering mr hassan and are to be sentenced in due course

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Here is a concise summary of the passage:

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"".

At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.

Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later.

World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies.

In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30.

England's Joe Root, promoted to number three for this series, was named man of the match after scoring 254 in the first innings and an unbeaten 71 off 48 balls in the second. He also took four catches in Pakistan's first-innings 198 and claimed a wicket in his only over as Pakistan were bowled out for 234 on Monday. ""It's great to see him stepping up to number three and playing with the responsibility there,"" said captain Alastair Cook, who made 105 and 76 not out. ""It's as good an innings as I've seen. He's an extraordinary player. He didn't put a foot wrong; he played beautifully."" Root, who twice fell to poor strokes in England's 75-run defeat in the first Test, said: ""It's a great feeling. ""Those two occasions at Lord's were batsman error on my part. I tried to cut that out of my game. It's the most controlled I've played."" Coach Trevor Bayliss said: ""He went away and did a bit of soul-searching and hard work, came back and did exactly what he said he was going to do."" Vaughan: added: ""This was his best Test-match innings.""

England won the second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford with a day to spare, leveling the series. England scored 589-8 declared and 173-1 declared, with Joe Root scoring 254 and 71* to be named man of the match. Pakistan were bowled out for 198 and 234, with England's bowlers dominating on a pitch that offered little assistance. The win was England's second biggest over Pakistan in terms of runs, and former England captain Michael Vaughan described it as ""an absolute hammering"".

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation. ""After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future. ""We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.""

"The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role.

At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club.

Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: ""I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline.

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270.

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner.

Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, has announced that he will extend his term by one year, until 2019, rather than leaving in 2018 as originally planned or staying until 2021. The decision was driven by personal reasons, specifically the need to balance his family life with the demands of the role. Carney's daughters will be finishing their A-levels and GCSEs in 2018, and he wants to return to Canada with his family at that time. The decision was not influenced by politics or criticism of the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts. Carney's extension will see him through the Brexit negotiations, but he will leave before the UK's exit from the EU is complete, allowing a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.",meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,0.56558,0.3029,0.10725,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.90087,1,0,0,1

by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .

in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .

Specifically, the author focuses on the two fights between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, which took place in 1980. In the first fight, Duran won a contentious decision, but in the rematch, Leonard used his speed and movement to outmaneuver Duran, who quit in the eighth round, saying ""no mas"". The result was a shock to the boxing world, and it took Duran three years to rebuild his reputation.

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '

However, the passage primarily focuses on the epic battle between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, which is considered one of the greatest fights in ring history. The two fighters had a trilogy of fights, with the first fight in 1980 being won by Duran in a contentious decision. In the rematch, Leonard used his exceptional speed and movement to outmaneuver Duran, who became frustrated and quit in the eighth round, famously saying ""no mas."" The result was a shock to the world, and it took Duran three years to rebuild his reputation. Leonard went on to win the third fight in 1989, and he considers forcing Duran to quit as one of his greatest achievements.",meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,0.50493,0.82766,0.84448,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.87291,0,0,0,1

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .
the care assistant , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .

born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .

speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .

"pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . '
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .
ilze zebolde , 31 , takes in her surrounds as she and pablo mandado take a break in their cycle journey around the world

latvian ilze sets up camp , the most common means of accommodation for her and pablo , on the stunning lake bled in slovenia
ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of
pablo and ilze 's tent in a field in bosnia - this is their usual means of accommodation although they often use hosting websites
pabo and ilze take a break in an italian mountain town as they work their way from france towards eastern europe
pablo rides along the waterside in thessaloniki , greece , one of more than 225 stops they 've made in their journey so far
all landscapes and settings are greeting pablo and ilze , including moody forests in france as they rode along both coasts
ilze rides into the clouds as pedal power takes her and pablo through eastern europe and towards asia , their next continent
the view from pablo and ilze 's tent as they awake to another day in the saddle as they live out their dream
pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world
` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says .
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .
finally going further away and into the unknown . '
they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '

to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products .
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )

losing an important paper or document ( 33 per cent )
nowhere to park ( 32 per cent )
printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .

whichever tweet has the most retweets , with the #everydayfix hashtag , by 46 april will go into a kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development .

born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .

often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .

speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .

in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .
ilze zebolde , 31 , takes in her surrounds as she and pablo mandado take a break in their cycle journey around the world
pablo , 27 , and ilze , 31 , stop for a picture in bosnia , one of the 16 countries they 've been through since leaving london last year
latvian ilze sets up camp , the most common means of accommodation for her and pablo , on the stunning lake bled in slovenia
ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of
pablo and ilze 's tent in a field in bosnia - this is their usual means of accommodation although they often use hosting websites
pabo and ilze take a break in an italian mountain town as they work their way from france towards eastern europe
pablo rides along the waterside in thessaloniki , greece , one of more than 222 stops they 've made in their journey so far
all landscapes and settings are greeting pablo and ilze , including moody forests in france as they rode along both coasts
ilze rides into the clouds as pedal power takes her and pablo through eastern europe and towards asia , their next continent
the view from pablo and ilze 's tent as they awake to another day in the saddle as they live out their dream
pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world
` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says .
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .
finally going further away and into the unknown . '
they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '
` we are going to be on the road for the following years , ' they say .","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information:

"have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door , been woken by a facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger ?
to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products .
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )
losing your keys ( 37 per cent )
being stuck in traffic when already late ( 35 per cent )
losing an important paper or document ( 33 per cent )
nowhere to park ( 32 per cent )
printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called snooze , shown , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep
whichever tweet has the most retweets , with the #everydayfix hashtag , by 40 april will go into a kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development .
` we 've seen the great british designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies , ' said paul smyth , co-founder of makerversity .
` through the direct line everyday fix event , we 've been able to extend our role as "" fixers "" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation 's everyday emergencies , ' added john shaw , head of r&d and innovation at direct line .
of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .
and as another solution to your phone running out of battery , one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies .
products that did n't make the final shortlist included the parking pin , shown .

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .
granger 's co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , ( left ) and nicholas chandler , 29 , ( right ) , both from south east london , have both been convicted of murdering mr hassan and are to be sentenced in due course

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.","Manchester United's Under 18s defeated Manchester City 1-0 in a ""mini-derby"" match.

"Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance. Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year. Chinese Grand Prix race results Chinese Grand Prix coverage details","Lewis Hamilton started from the back of the pack and had a disastrous race, suffering a broken front wing on the first lap and making five pit stops. Despite this, he is confident he can close the 36-point gap to Nico Rosberg in the remaining 18 races. Rosberg won the race after Ricciardo's puncture allowed him to take the lead. Vettel finished second after a collision with Raikkonen on the first lap, and Raikkonen finished fifth after a strong comeback.

"The magnitude-4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) 35km north of the city of Lucca, officials said. The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement. The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory"" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake. At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely. On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.","A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck 35km north of Lucca, Italy, at a depth of 15.5km.

"The girl, aged 15 at the time, had met a man called David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage in the autumn of 2004. The defendant, now 34 and called Davina, denied the charge. She will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody and said it was likely she would be held at a male prison. He added: ""If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason. ""I will therefore have to remand in custody. It will have to be a male prison in Winchester but it will be an issue for the prison service."" He also told the jury at Portsmouth Crown Court: ""It's been a slightly unusual case and it's not been an easy case."" The court heard that Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, attempted to commit suicide last summer. Protocols have been put in place for her detention at the prison, a court officer explained. During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not ""made any physical changes or enhancements"" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage. The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had ""only drunk a can and a half of Foster's"" and clearly recollected the events.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park.

""We would have had to go off for the roof to go on, so that would have meant a change in conditions. I'm pleased to get off in four."" Media playback is not supported on this device Murray looked like avoiding a long, drawn-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded. Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. ""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","On January 20, 2017, militants armed with guns and grenades attacked a hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation. ""After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future. ""We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.""

"The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role. Leyton Orient interim manager Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device ""For me to lose two managers this season has been very tough and I've found it very hard this week. ""We had to be professional, we're here to do a job and if I wasn't professional then I wouldn't be true to myself. ""We owe it to the fans. At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club. ""We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs."" Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: ""I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline. ""If you haven't got organisation and you haven't got the discipline to play 90 minutes, the outcome is inevitable. ""Dagenham over the years are going to get beat, it's responding to that that the club's not been able to do this year.""","Dagenham & Redbridge, who reached League One in 2010, were relegated to the National League after losing to Leyton Orient. Dagenham's manager, John Still, said his team lacked organization and discipline, which led to their defeat. Leyton Orient's interim manager, Andy Hessenthaler, said the team had to be professional and win games to make the playoffs.

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","Adrian Gill, a well-known journalist for the Sunday Times, passed away after a battle with cancer.

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. ""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: ""We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. ""The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably.""","Surrey defeated Yorkshire in a T20 Blast match, winning by 19 runs.

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.""","UK Sport has announced funding for 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports for the Tokyo 2020 Games, totaling £345 million.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner. The shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. Coverage from this year's ceremony, where the prize will be presented by the Duchess of Cornwall. will be on the BBC News Channel from 2130 BST and on BBC Arts.","The 2014 Man Booker Prize shortlist includes six novels: *The Lives of Others* by Jhumpa Lahiri, *J* by Howard Jacobson, *How To Be Both* by Ali Smith, *To Rise Again at a Decent Hour* by Joshua Ferris, *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves* by Karen Joy Fowler, and *The Narrow Road to the Deep North* by Richard Flanagan.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Benteke becomes the Reds' second most expensive signing, on what the club describe as a ""long-term contract"". Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad. ""I'm a lot more optimistic than I was this time last year. The strikers only scored eight goals last year, we can only do better than that going forward.""

"The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place. But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. ""Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,"" she said. ""We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. ""It would be more heartbreak than humiliation."" Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. ""Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,"" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. ""It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. ""I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead."" With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. ""Iceland are top seeds in the group,"" Evans noted. ""They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. ""But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. ""It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference."" Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. ""It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,"" she recalled. ""There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. ""We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. ""I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us."" Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. ""Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,"" she added. ""The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. ""Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. ""The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. ""It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.""","Scotland's women's national football team is on the verge of qualifying for the 2017 European Championship. They have won all five of their qualifying matches and are in a strong position to reach the finals in the Netherlands.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. ""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, announced he would extend his term by one year, until 2019. This decision was driven by personal reasons, as his family is planning to return to Canada in 2018. Carney felt it would be difficult to leave during the Brexit negotiations, but he was not willing to extend his term to 2021. He felt that a one-year extension would allow him to see the Article 50 process through, while also allowing his family to return to Canada.

` the belly and tips of the propellers impacted the runway ( the sound of the propellers hitting the surface was one sound you will not forget ) .
` once the pilot realized his mistake , he gave what appeared to be full throttle and both propellers pulled the front of the aircraft down with the propellers making a second impact with the runway .
` somehow the engines stayed on and running and the pilot was able to regain control while leaving the airport .

the most common cause of a gear-up landing , also known as a belly landing or pancake landing , is human error -- when the pilot simply forgets to deploy the landing gear before touchdown .
another cause is mechanical fault , when an electric motor or a hydraulic actuator fails .

"rory mcilroy believes it is ` unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam .
and the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at augusta national in 2011 was the most important day of his career .
mcilroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus and tiger woods .
rory mcilroy tees off at the arnold palmer invitational golf tournament in orlando on march 19
` for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland .
` there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year .
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions .
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome .
it would just be incredible .
` you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much .
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . '
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round .
mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month
but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket .
` during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added .
` if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time .
if i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed .
` and not just one .
i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on .
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . '
mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel .
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year .
mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added .
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much .
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot .
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position .
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out .
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . '
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february .

several of the images have also been defaced by bloggers , angry at the perceived insinuation that only women who look like renee are ready to go to the beach .
the advertising standards authority has also received more than 200 complaints from people saying that the adverts promote an unhealthy body image .

the posters are now being removed from the london underground
a tfl spokesperson told mailonline : ` this advertisement will begin to be removed from our network as scheduled from tomorrow .
` we have received one complaint about it and we will be guided by the committee of advertising practice ( cap ) and advertising standards authority ( asa ) if a similar advert were to be submitted again .
` we have zero tolerance towards graffiti on the network and take action to prevent it and remove it . '
the removal of the posters comes as a protest organised against protein world in hyde park on may 2 gathers steam - hundreds of people are expected to attend the rally in central london .
the posters have caused a huge backlash on social media , with thousands of tweets directed at the campaign .
one user called catrin stewartwrite : ` you clearly know what you 're trying to sell with that offensive , unrealistic and sexist advert . '
another called livy christophers said : ` you do n't get to tell women what is offensive .

the good morning britain presenter and her co-host ben shephard grilled richard staveley about the uproar surrounding the poster , which has attracted the wrath of many social media users .
many have been outraged that the advert appears to suggest women can not go on the beach in a bikini unless they look like the slim model in the advert .

'
the tv stars also addressed the company 's blunt responses to twitter complaints , including ` why make your insecurities our problem ' and ` grow up ' .
but staveley believes the reaction is justified , saying , ` there is an irrational minority who have decided to interpret it in that way . '
susanna , 44 , retorted : ` do you think everybody who objects to it is irrational ?
am i an irrational extremist ? '
defending protein world : richard staveley , head of global marketing , insisted the company 's advert was n't meant to offend and was targeted at health-conscious individuals looking to get fit in time for summer

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight

july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 2012 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out .

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","The fight between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran is considered one of the most important fights in boxing history.

co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter

all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Leonie Granger, an aspiring model, was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the manslaughter of professional gambler Mehmet Hassan. Granger befriended Hassan at a casino and lured him back to his flat, where her boyfriend and accomplice tied him up, kicked him to death, and stole his winnings. Granger's co-defendants, Kyrron Jackson and Nicholas Chandler, were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 36 years. The judge described the attack as ""pitiless and wicked"" and said that Granger had been ""deceitful from the outset"" and had ""lost her sense and compassion"" when she got involved in the scheme.

"manchester united have ramped up their efforts to sign psv eindhoven star memphis depay by making an official approach for the 21-year-old .
the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .
van gaal is already familiar with the qualities of depay having named him in his 23-man world cup squad last year as holland finished third in brazil .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .

the 21-year-old took his tally to 20 on saturday psv eindhoven beat heerenveen 4-1 to win the dutch championship on saturday for the first time in seven seasons .
the dutch league 's leading scorer doubled the hosts ' lead midway through the first half with a stunning free kick after luuk de jong headed them ahead early on .
heerenveen midfielder joey van den berg pulled a goal back for his side before de jong restored the two-goal advantage just before half-time and luciano narsingh added a fourth late on .
it is a 22nd league championship for psv , who are second only to ajax ( 33 titles ) in holland .
psv eindhoven won there first eredivisie title in seven years after beating heerenveen 4-1 on saturday

born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-20 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.
having impressed in brazil , depay was nominated for the tournament 's ` best young player ' award but lost out to france midfielder paul pogba .

they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .

pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .

"manchester united have ramped up their efforts to sign psv eindhoven star memphis depay by making an official approach for the 21-year-old .
the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .
van gaal is already familiar with the qualities of depay having named him in his 23-man world cup squad last year as holland finished third in brazil .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .
the 21-year-old ( left ) has scored 20 goals in 26 league games for psv this season
the 21-year-old took his tally to 20 on saturday psv eindhoven beat heerenveen 4-1 to win the dutch championship on saturday for the first time in seven seasons .
the dutch league 's leading scorer doubled the hosts ' lead midway through the first half with a stunning free kick after luuk de jong headed them ahead early on .
heerenveen midfielder joey van den berg pulled a goal back for his side before de jong restored the two-goal advantage just before half-time and luciano narsingh added a fourth late on .
it is a 22nd league championship for psv , who are second only to ajax ( 33 titles ) in holland .
psv eindhoven won there first eredivisie title in seven years after beating heerenveen 4-1 on saturday
depay ( right ) celebrates the dutch giants ' success with manager phillip cocu after the match
born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-13 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.
having impressed in brazil , depay was nominated for the tournament 's ` best young player ' award but lost out to france midfielder paul pogba .

"pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . '
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .

ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of

` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .

they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .
the care assistant , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .
granger 's co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , ( left ) and nicholas chandler , 29 , ( right ) , both from south east london , have both been convicted of murdering mr hassan and are to be sentenced in due course

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Leonie Granger, an aspiring model, was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the manslaughter of professional gambler Mehmet Hassan. Granger befriended Hassan at a casino and lured him back to his flat, where her boyfriend and an accomplice tied him up, beat him to death, and stole his winnings. Granger's co-defendants, Kyrron Jackson and Nicholas Chandler, were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 36 years. The court heard that Hassan was a ""soft target"" who enjoyed the company of women and kept large sums of cash in his flat.

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. ""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: ""We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. ""The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably.""","The passage describes a cricket match between Surrey and Yorkshire.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park. The fourth-tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday, but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian. Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross.

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.""","The UK government has cut funding for several sports, including archery, fencing, weightlifting, wheelchair rugby, and badminton. Cycling has also had its funding reduced.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation. ""After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future. ""We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.""

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series.

"Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The Briton, 30, won 6-2 4-6 6-1 7-5 after two hours and 39 minutes, with match point clinched at 20:57 BST.

""We would have had to go off for the roof to go on, so that would have meant a change in conditions. I'm pleased to get off in four."" Media playback is not supported on this device Murray looked like avoiding a long, drawn-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded. Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. ""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. ""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","Militants armed with guns and grenades attacked a hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing staff and patients. The attackers were eventually killed by commandos. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack, while the Taliban denied involvement. Over 50 people were wounded in the attack.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books.""

Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing that he would extend his term for just one more year instead of the expected full eight years. Speculation arose about whether Carney felt political pressure or was disillusioned by the economic predictions for the UK. However, the main reason for his decision was personal - his daughters would be finishing their exams in 2018, and he wanted to return to Canada and its education system. Carney's decision was not influenced by tension with the Prime Minister or criticism of the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts. He believed it would be difficult to leave during the Brexit negotiations, but with his family leaving in 2018, he could only extend his term by one year.",openai/GPT-3.5-Turbo,0.96428,0.97493,0.98745,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.96887,1,0,1,1

"The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One.

Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season.

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","Adrian Gill, a columnist for the Sunday Times, passed away suddenly after being diagnosed with multiple cancers. Gill was highly regarded as a journalist and known for his wit, fearless writing, and intelligence. His final column, discussing his diagnosis, will be published in tomorrow's Sunday Times.

"The girl, aged 15 at the time, had met a man called David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage in the autumn of 2004. The defendant, now 34 and called Davina, denied the charge. She will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody and said it was likely she would be held at a male prison. He added: ""If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason. ""I will therefore have to remand in custody. It will have to be a male prison in Winchester but it will be an issue for the prison service."" He also told the jury at Portsmouth Crown Court: ""It's been a slightly unusual case and it's not been an easy case."" The court heard that Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, attempted to commit suicide last summer. Protocols have been put in place for her detention at the prison, a court officer explained. During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not ""made any physical changes or enhancements"" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage. The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had ""only drunk a can and a half of Foster's"" and clearly recollected the events. The court heard that in 2014 Ayrton told a worker at the care home where she lived in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, about the attack.","The passage describes a court case involving a 34-year-old defendant named Davina, who is accused of raping a 15-year-old girl in a garage in Portsmouth in 2004.

"The magnitude-4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) 35km north of the city of Lucca, officials said. The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement. The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory"" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake. At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely. On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.","A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck 35km north of Lucca, Italy, at a depth of 15.5km.

This is the first sighting of the species in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. The discovery is significant for scientists as very little is known about the species, which was only described in scientific journals in 2003. The whale has unique skeletal features and is usually found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. The carcass has been buried, and the skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific investigation and possibly for public display in museums.",openai/GPT-3.5-Turbo,0.99937,0.86105,0.97408,1,1.0,1,0,1,0.93855,0,1,0,1
"a three-bedroom apartment in one of the most expensive areas to live in britain has been put on the market for just £ 575,000 - but the ` bargain ' property comes with a catch .
the knightsbridge flat , london , which is on sale for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes , has just three years left on the lease .
the cost would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area .
the entrance to the flats in one of the most expensive areas to live in britain where a three-bedroom apartment has been put on the market for just £ 575,000
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the property could be worth upwards of £ 6 million .
the ` unmodernised ' maisonette in the in exclusive egerton place , is described as ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space .
it boasts three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a reception room and utility room along with a lift , parking and a communal garden .
the property is being sold by russell simpson for £ 575,000 - the same price as a three-bedroom house in stanmore , middlesex .
it is one of two maisonettes being sold with three years remaining on the lease .
both homes will need to be modernised , with the second , larger property - also on egerton place - on the market for £ 595,000 .
the next cheapest three-bedroom property in knightsbridge costs £ 1.5 million , and this flat is only offered with a 28-year lease .
but the property comes with a catch , not only is it in dire need of renovation , ( such as in one of its bedrooms , pictured ) the home has just three years left on the lease
the cost for £ 575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area , plus renovation works which are needed , such as in the living room ( pictured )
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space , could be worth upwards of £ 6 million
jake russell , from russell simpson , said : ` properties like this come up once in a blue moon and i think it is an outstanding opportunity .
` to get properties like this in egerton place is very exciting and the phone has n't stopped ringing , which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner .
` we have had interest from locals , developers and end users .
in modernised condition , we would estimate they would sell for between £ 2,750 and £ 3,000 per sq/ft . '
this gives the smaller property a £ 6 million prices tag , while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £ 7.5 million .
the current freeholder is thought to be the welcome trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and , for a 90-year lease , it is likely to cost between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million .
egerton place was built off michael 's grove by john grover and son to the designs of architect mervyn macartney around 1893 .
the properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the egerton gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets , finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange .
estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone ` has n't stopped ringing ' about the egerton place apartment
but alex newall , from hanover private office , had a warning to potential buyers : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease '
leases of all the homes were granted by the smith 's charity trustees in 1894 , and its first occupant was , sir evan macgregor , permanent secretary to the admiralty .
other residents of high status included the dowager lady lawrence , probably the widow of the first baron lawrence , at no. 5 , and sir henry fielding dickens , q.c. , son of the novelist charles at no. 2 .
one property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases .
alex newall , from hanover private office , said : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease .
` a developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder .
` it is a very quirky situation .
properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like knightsbridge .
` i know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought ` right , i need to extend it ' , but by then it was too late and the extension was too much .
` let it be a warning to check your lease . '","A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London is on the market for £575,000, significantly cheaper than neighboring properties. However, the catch is that the lease only has three years remaining. The cost of the lease would be £191,000 per year or £15,000 per month, which is similar to the rental rate in the area.

in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '

after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .

"campaigners against the new protein world ` are you beach body ready ? '
adverts are celebrating today after learning that they are being taken down .
transport for london ( tfl ) has revealed that the controversial posters around the london underground , featuring a bikini-clad model called renee somerfield are being removed .
the sight of the 24-year-old 's toned figure towering above train platforms has caused a stir among feminists and body image campaigners - a change.org petition calling for the adverts to be pulled has already attracted more than 50,000 signatures .
one of the many protein world posters on the london underground that have been defaced
several of the images have also been defaced by bloggers , angry at the perceived insinuation that only women who look like renee are ready to go to the beach .
the advertising standards authority has also received more than 200 complaints from people saying that the adverts promote an unhealthy body image .
but today , tfl confirmed that it was pulling the posters down , because they had come to the end of the three-week advertising period that protein world had paid for .
the company also said it had taken note of the reaction from customers to the advert and that they would bear it in mind if they received a request to put up posters of a similar nature in future .
the posters are now being removed from the london underground
a tfl spokesperson told mailonline : ` this advertisement will begin to be removed from our network as scheduled from tomorrow .
` we have received one complaint about it and we will be guided by the committee of advertising practice ( cap ) and advertising standards authority ( asa ) if a similar advert were to be submitted again .
` we have zero tolerance towards graffiti on the network and take action to prevent it and remove it . '
the removal of the posters comes as a protest organised against protein world in hyde park on may 2 gathers steam - hundreds of people are expected to attend the rally in central london .
the posters have caused a huge backlash on social media , with thousands of tweets directed at the campaign .
one user called catrin stewartwrite : ` you clearly know what you 're trying to sell with that offensive , unrealistic and sexist advert . '
another called livy christophers said : ` you do n't get to tell women what is offensive .
"" are you beach body ready "" really means "" why do n't you look like this . "" '

online fitness store protein world , who claim that the image is entirely unphotoshopped , have been actively engaging in the furore on social media , strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved tweeters .
` we are a nation of sympathisers for fatties , ' a spokesperson for protein world tweeted to one user after she signed the change.org petition calling for the removal of the advert .
` why make your insecurities our problem ? '
tv presenter susanna reid described the campaign for protein shakes , which features a toned swimwear-clad model alongside the slogan ` are you beach body ready ? '
, as ` anxiety inducing ' during an interview with the fitness brand 's head of global marketing on monday morning .
the good morning britain presenter and her co-host ben shephard grilled richard staveley about the uproar surrounding the poster , which has attracted the wrath of many social media users .
many have been outraged that the advert appears to suggest women can not go on the beach in a bikini unless they look like the slim model in the advert .
` what if my only goal is to be on a beach ? '
, susanna asked richard , adding , ` am i irrational by finding that advert a little bit anxiety inducing ? '
weighing in on the debate : susanna reid revealed she found the controversial protein world advert ` anxiety inducing ' on good morning britain on monday
security threat : staveley revealed police were investigating a bomb threat made to the company
the protein world boss defended the campaign , saying : ` that may be but we are a fitness brand , our own aspirations are to make the nation healthier and ask each one of us to set our sights higher , to be fitter , to be healthier and actually have an inner and outer confidence within ourselves . '
the tv stars also addressed the company 's blunt responses to twitter complaints , including ` why make your insecurities our problem ' and ` grow up ' .
but staveley believes the reaction is justified , saying , ` there is an irrational minority who have decided to interpret it in that way . '

staveley concluded his appearance on the itv show by declaring that it had been a ` fantastic campaign ' for the brand and they wo n't changing their advertising methods in future .
the advertising standards authority ( asa ) said it has received 216 complaints about the advert and is ` carefully assessing ' the complaints to ` establish if there are grounds for further action ' .
sales of protein powder - which can be priced up to £ 45 per kilogram tub - are rocketing in the uk , growing from £ 73m in 2007 to £ 170m in 2012 .
they are expected to reach £ 358m by 2017 , according to the market-analyst euromonitor , as gym-going brits add the stuff to post-workout smoothies and drinks in a bid to build muscle .

* that * ad totally worked for me . '","Transport for London (TFL) has announced that the controversial Protein World advertisements featuring a bikini-clad model will be taken down from the London Underground. The posters have received backlash from feminists and body image campaigners, with over 50,000 signatures on a petition calling for their removal. Some of the posters have also been defaced by bloggers. TFL stated that the posters were being removed because the advertising period had ended, but they also took note of customer reactions and would consider them for future similar requests. The removal of the posters coincides with a protest against Protein World in Hyde Park. The company claims that the image in the advertisement is unphotoshopped and has defended their campaign on social media. The Advertising Standards Authority has received over 200 complaints about the advertisements promoting an unhealthy body image. Sales of protein powder in the UK have been increasing, reaching £170m in 2012 and expected to reach £358m by 2017.",openai/GPT-3.5-Turbo,0.24122,0.98315,0.99505,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.9323,0,0,0,1

the plant was hit by another explosion in july 2013 , although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time .
though demonstrations are illegal in china , the construction of px plants has sparked protests , which have occasionally turned violent , in several cities in recent years .
the zhangzhou plant was slated for xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country .
however , it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current , more remote location .","An explosion occurred at a chemical plant in Zhangzhou city, China, causing a large fire.

"rory mcilroy believes it is ` unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam .
and the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at augusta national in 2011 was the most important day of his career .
mcilroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus and tiger woods .
rory mcilroy tees off at the arnold palmer invitational golf tournament in orlando on march 19
` for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland .
` there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year .
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions .
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome .
it would just be incredible .
` you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much .
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . '
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round .
mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month
but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket .
` during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added .
` if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time .
if i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed .
` and not just one .
i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on .
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . '
mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel .
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year .
mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added .
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much .
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot .
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position .
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out .
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . '
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february .

it really did , ' he added .

"this is the moment an aeroplane touched down on a runway without deploying its landing gear and skidded along the runway on its belly .
captured in fort pierce , florida , the shocking footage shows the light general aviation aircraft approaching the aero acres residential airpark .
despite the fact the aerostar plane travels at speed , its descent towards the landing strip appears normal until the video maker makes a startling observation .
the light general aviation aircraft approaches the aero acres residential airpark and touches down without its landing gear deployed
he states that the landing gear has not been deployed and at that very moment the plane touches down with a bump and scratches along the tarmac .
its propellers can be heard ricocheting off the ground as the wings bounce up and down from the impact .
suddenly the pilot re-engages the engines and rather unceremoniously takes off back into the air .
the plane 's propellers can be heard ricocheting off the ground as the wings bounce up and down from the impact
the video maker can be heard saying that the plane 's propellers have been damaged in the collision with the runway and that more than likely , the pilot will crash .
he later said : ` i was walking down the flight line of aircraft that flew in for the day , which is close to the main runway and noticed this light twin aircraft coming in low .
` i noticed he did not have his landing gear down and thought he was going to do a fly-by , but then noticed the power was pulled back with the aircraft approaching for a landing with no landing gear .
the plane scratches along the runway and the video maker describes the sound as ` one you will not forget '
` the belly and tips of the propellers impacted the runway ( the sound of the propellers hitting the surface was one sound you will not forget ) .
` once the pilot realized his mistake , he gave what appeared to be full throttle and both propellers pulled the front of the aircraft down with the propellers making a second impact with the runway .
` somehow the engines stayed on and running and the pilot was able to regain control while leaving the airport .
the video maker noted that once the pilot realized his mistake he began re-engaging the engine
he added : ` it 's amazing the aeroplane engines did not get destroyed during the propellers impact and the pilot did not stall during the forced take-off with the high angle of attack and damaged propellers . '
according to wpbf 25 news , the plane 's pilot , chris georgaklis , 85 , managed to fly 100 miles to fort lauderdale after the incident and landed safely .
mr georgaklis is said to have flown for almost 50 years and was accompanied on the trip by his dog , buddy .
people look on as the damaged aircraft takes off from the runway and flies 100 miles to fort lauderdale , where it landed safely
the most common cause of a gear-up landing , also known as a belly landing or pancake landing , is human error -- when the pilot simply forgets to deploy the landing gear before touchdown .
another cause is mechanical fault , when an electric motor or a hydraulic actuator fails .
the faa is said to be investigating the incident .","The passage describes a shocking incident where an aeroplane landed on a runway without deploying its landing gear and skidded along the runway on its belly.

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement.

At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.

""We would have had to go off for the roof to go on, so that would have meant a change in conditions. I'm pleased to get off in four."" Media playback is not supported on this device Murray looked like avoiding a long, drawn-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded. Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. ""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday. ""I'm happy to get through the first week and anything can happen from here on.""","Andy Murray, a 30-year-old Briton, won a tense match against Fabio Fognini, the 29th seed, with a score of 6-2 4-6 6-1 7-5, securing his place in the last 16 for the 11th time.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","Militants armed with guns and grenades attacked Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul, with one detonating explosives at the gate and opening fire on staff and patients. Commandos killed all four attackers after several hours. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility, while the Taliban denied involvement. Over 50 people were wounded. This attack marks a shift in IS tactics in Afghanistan, directly engaging security forces in the capital for the first time.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation. ""After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future. ""We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.""

"The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role.

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced.

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. ""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: ""We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. ""The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably.""","Surrey recovered from 8-2 to post 255-7, thanks to a 130-run partnership between Davies and Ben Foakes (90). Yorkshire's chase was disrupted by Stuart Meaker's three-wicket burst, including key dismissals of Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Despite Tim Bresnan's 68, Yorkshire were all out for 236. Yorkshire, aiming to reach Lord's for the first time since 2002, started well but faltered after Matthew Waite dropped Davies, who went on to score significantly. Meaker's crucial wickets turned the game, and despite efforts from Bresnan and Waite, Yorkshire fell short. Surrey's captain praised the team's collective effort, while Yorkshire's captain expressed disappointment over missed opportunities.",openai/gpt-4o,0.72555,0.81924,0.93323,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.74738,1,0,1,1
"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.""","The passage discusses the allocation of funding for Olympic and Paralympic sports by UK Sport for the Tokyo 2020 Games. Archery, fencing, weightlifting, and wheelchair rugby have lost funding, while cycling's budget was reduced by over £4m. Badminton, despite winning a bronze medal in Rio, had its funding completely removed, a decision criticized by Badminton England's chief executive. Overall, £345m will be invested in 31 sports, £2m less than for the Rio Games. UK Sport aims for Team GB to win 51-85 Olympic and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Despite the cuts, the government remains committed to funding. Judo's funding increased slightly, while basketball, handball, and volleyball, which lost funding in previous years, criticized UK Sport for neglecting team sports. Funding for new sports added for Tokyo 2020, including baseball/softball, karate, and others, is still pending based on medal potential.",openai/gpt-4o,0.66248,0.69204,0.96182,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.92462,1,0,1,1

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Benteke becomes the Reds' second most expensive signing, on what the club describe as a ""long-term contract"". Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession.

There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. ""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

Despite three Cas tries in four minutes - Larne Patrick, Luke Gale and Flynn's hat-trick score - Widnes held on. The Vikings' victory had looked assured when Mellor took advantage of Castleford indecision on a short kick-off, running straight through to help them to a 26-point lead. But, having lost nine of their previous 10 matches, their defence creaked as they let Patrick, who has just signed a three-year deal to move from Huddersfield after his loan spell, in for a try.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, announced a surprising decision to extend his term by only one year instead of staying until 2021 or leaving in 2018 as initially planned. This decision was influenced by personal reasons, particularly his family's preference to return to Canada for his daughters' education. Carney's choice came amidst the backdrop of Brexit negotiations, where his continued presence was seen as stabilizing for the economy. Despite speculation about political pressure or disillusionment with economic forecasts, Carney emphasized that his decision was entirely personal and not influenced by government policy or criticism. He acknowledged the importance of his role but felt unable to commit beyond 2019 due to family considerations.",openai/gpt-4o,0.93369,0.78991,0.34556,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.9548,1,0,1,1

the posters have caused a huge backlash on social media , with thousands of tweets directed at the campaign .
one user called catrin stewartwrite : ` you clearly know what you 're trying to sell with that offensive , unrealistic and sexist advert . '

the good morning britain presenter and her co-host ben shephard grilled richard staveley about the uproar surrounding the poster , which has attracted the wrath of many social media users .
many have been outraged that the advert appears to suggest women can not go on the beach in a bikini unless they look like the slim model in the advert .

where money man v pacman comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the mgm grand garden arena .
in this , the sixth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history , i recall when a hard man could take no more ...
sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 2012 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out .

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .
kaiser health news ( khn ) is a nonprofit national health policy news service .","A major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found that heavy drinking among Americans increased by 17.2% from 2005 to 2012, driven largely by rising rates among women.

but the property comes with a catch , not only is it in dire need of renovation , ( such as in one of its bedrooms , pictured ) the home has just three years left on the lease
the cost for £ 575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area , plus renovation works which are needed , such as in the living room ( pictured )
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space , could be worth upwards of £ 6 million
jake russell , from russell simpson , said : ` properties like this come up once in a blue moon and i think it is an outstanding opportunity .
` to get properties like this in egerton place is very exciting and the phone has n't stopped ringing , which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner .
` we have had interest from locals , developers and end users .
in modernised condition , we would estimate they would sell for between £ 2,750 and £ 3,000 per sq/ft . '
this gives the smaller property a £ 6 million prices tag , while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £ 7.5 million .
the current freeholder is thought to be the welcome trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and , for a 90-year lease , it is likely to cost between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million .
egerton place was built off michael 's grove by john grover and son to the designs of architect mervyn macartney around 1893 .
the properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the egerton gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets , finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange .
estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone ` has n't stopped ringing ' about the egerton place apartment
but alex newall , from hanover private office , had a warning to potential buyers : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease '
leases of all the homes were granted by the smith 's charity trustees in 1894 , and its first occupant was , sir evan macgregor , permanent secretary to the admiralty .
other residents of high status included the dowager lady lawrence , probably the widow of the first baron lawrence , at no. 5 , and sir henry fielding dickens , q.c. , son of the novelist charles at no. 2 .
one property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases .
alex newall , from hanover private office , said : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease .
` a developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder .
` it is a very quirky situation .
properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like knightsbridge .
` i know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought ` right , i need to extend it ' , but by then it was too late and the extension was too much .
` let it be a warning to check your lease . '","A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, is on the market for £575,000, significantly lower than neighboring properties, due to having only three years left on its lease. The cost equates to £191,000 per year, similar to rental rates in the area. The flat, described as ""bright and well proportioned"" with 1,990 sq/ft, requires modernization. Extending the lease could increase its value to over £6 million, but the extension could cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million.

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","The passage discusses the significance of the Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight, predicting it will be the most financially lucrative and significant fight of the century. It then delves into the complexities of evaluating the greatest boxing matches, considering various factors beyond just the action in the ring. The passage highlights the historic fights between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, particularly focusing on their second fight in 1980 where Leonard's strategy led to Duran's infamous ""no mas"" moment, quitting in the eighth round. This event shocked the world and tarnished Duran's reputation, which he only managed to restore three years later by winning another title. Leonard, who won their third fight in 1989, considered making Duran quit a greater achievement than knocking him out.",openai/gpt-4o,0.69975,0.96681,0.97118,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.818,0,0,0,1

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .
the care assistant , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .

sportsmail was at the academy stadium to see how the youngsters got on ...
tammy abraham smashes chelsea into the lead with a fierce drive into the top corner
kjetil haug : norwegian international has been on the bench for long periods but got the nod and looked shaky under the high ball .
that said , powerless to stop abraham 's volleys and soalnke 's killer .
pablo maffeo : barcelona-born former espanyol youngster is not the tallest and at times struggled with chelsea 's diagonals early on but grew into the game and could have levelled .
tosin adarabioyo : manchester lad and england youth international , city 's captain was a commanding presence at the heart of defence .
has the movement of yaya toure but put a big shift in .
christian haug goes up for the ball under pressure from chelsea forwards during the youth cup final
cameron humphreys-grant : has captained england and , like adarabioyo had his hands full against a vibrant chelsea attack but stood up to the test well .
jose angelino tasende : spanish left-back is not the tallest and was not able to drive forward as much as he would have liked against strong opposition .
kean bryan : box-to-box midfielder from beswick , yards away from the etihad stadium , pulled up injured after 36 minutes but battled back bravely but missed a glorious chance to tie things up .
manchester city midfielder kean bryan tracks the run of dominic solanke as city looked to stem the tide
aaron nemane : moved to manchester from france as a toddler , the wide man who scored twice in the first leg of the semi final did outwitted dasilva with a delightful tap and go but could not find the final , killer ball .
blasted wide when should have levelled .
bersant celina : kosovan international celina struggled to fill in for injured star thierry ambrose , seeing one shot from the edge of the area easily held by collins .
manu garcia : joined city from sporting gijon and the mini david silva showed some neat touches on the rare occasions he found space .
was largely ineffective and should have done better when teed up by barker late on .
manuel garcia gets a shot away , but it was blocked by jake clarke-salter
isaac buckley-ricketts : pacy mancunian centre forward produced measured finish to bring city level but was marshalled well for the majority of the evening .

ola aina : england under-19 right-back found space time and time again down the right .
quick , strong and often influential .
jake clarke-salter : england under 18s international often too strong for buckley-ricketts and , on the evidence of this sterling performance , is one to watch .
jay dasilva : under-21 regular is still 16 .
fortunate to escape at least a caution with a from-behind challenge in the first half but was solid at the back and lively going forward , whipping in a number of decent crosses .
ruben sammut : scottish youth international covered his back four expertly and kickstarted a number of breaks as city pressed .
ruben sammut plays the ball out in an excellent performance protecting the back four
tammy abraham : two volleys for his 35th and 36th strikes of the season .
big , bold and often brilliant , chelsea will be hoping the injury that saw him substituted on 67 minutes is not serious .
charlie colkett : put in a captain 's shift in the centre of the park as the visitors won the midfield battle .
is tipped for big things and showed just why .
abraham makes it 2-1 at the academy stadium with an acrobatic finish past christian haug
dominic solanke : scored for england in the european under-17 championship final and put in a powerful shift here , teaming up well with abraham before effectively killing the tie with a neat third .
charly musonda : the belgian playmaker , the only overseas man in the starting xi , was quiet by his standards and drilled a decent chance tamely wide .
isaiah brown : said to be interesting jose mourinho but will not want to dwell on his big moment early on when he blasted over bar when unmarked on the edge of the box .
miss aside , was a constant menace .

"pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . '
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .
ilze zebolde , 31 , takes in her surrounds as she and pablo mandado take a break in their cycle journey around the world
pablo , 27 , and ilze , 31 , stop for a picture in bosnia , one of the 16 countries they 've been through since leaving london last year
latvian ilze sets up camp , the most common means of accommodation for her and pablo , on the stunning lake bled in slovenia
ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of
pablo and ilze 's tent in a field in bosnia - this is their usual means of accommodation although they often use hosting websites
pabo and ilze take a break in an italian mountain town as they work their way from france towards eastern europe
pablo rides along the waterside in thessaloniki , greece , one of more than 225 stops they 've made in their journey so far
all landscapes and settings are greeting pablo and ilze , including moody forests in france as they rode along both coasts
ilze rides into the clouds as pedal power takes her and pablo through eastern europe and towards asia , their next continent
the view from pablo and ilze 's tent as they awake to another day in the saddle as they live out their dream
pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world
` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says .
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .
finally going further away and into the unknown . '
they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '
` we are going to be on the road for the following years , ' they say .","Pablo Mandado and Ilze Zebolde, a couple with no fixed plans or agenda, embarked on a global cycling journey after quitting their restaurant jobs in Manchester.

leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .

discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about

Depay has had a prolific season, scoring 20 goals in 26 league games and helping PSV win their first Eredivisie title in seven years. Despite interest from other top European clubs, United are currently leading the race to sign him. Depay, known for his pace, dribbling, and powerful right-foot shots, has been compared to Arjen Robben and a young Cristiano Ronaldo. He has already made over 100 appearances for PSV and has been recognized for his performances at the World Cup.",openai/gpt-4o,0.48958,0.9707,0.98833,1,1.0,1,1,1,0.83497,0,0,1,1

"pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . '
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .
ilze zebolde , 31 , takes in her surrounds as she and pablo mandado take a break in their cycle journey around the world
pablo , 27 , and ilze , 31 , stop for a picture in bosnia , one of the 16 countries they 've been through since leaving london last year
latvian ilze sets up camp , the most common means of accommodation for her and pablo , on the stunning lake bled in slovenia
ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .
ilze walks with her bike while pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in turkey , which they traversed the entire north of

` cycling over the bridge at the border between greece and turkey was symbolic , ' pablo says .
` riding away from europe , finally crossing into a different continent .
finally going further away and into the unknown . '
they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '

"have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door , been woken by a facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger ?
to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products .
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )
losing your keys ( 37 per cent )
being stuck in traffic when already late ( 35 per cent )
losing an important paper or document ( 33 per cent )
nowhere to park ( 32 per cent )
printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about

of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .
granger 's co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , ( left ) and nicholas chandler , 29 , ( right ) , both from south east london , have both been convicted of murdering mr hassan and are to be sentenced in due course

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him .

It's as good a four days of cricket that you could wish for from an England point of view,\" Vaughan told Test Match Special. England's Joe Root, promoted to number three for this series, was named man of the match after scoring 254 in the first innings and an unbeaten 71 off 48 balls in the second. He also took four catches in Pakistan's first-innings 198 and claimed a wicket in his only over as Pakistan were bowled out for 234 on Monday. \"It's great to see him stepping up to number three and playing with the responsibility there,\" said captain Alastair Cook, who made 105 and 76 not out. \"It's as good an innings as I've seen. He's an extraordinary player. He didn't put a foot wrong; he played beautifully.\" Root, who twice fell to poor strokes in England's 75-run defeat in the first Test, said: \"It's a great feeling. \"Those two occasions at Lord's were batsman error on my part. I tried to cut that out of my game. It's the most controlled I've played.\" Coach Trevor Bayliss said: \"He went away and did a bit of soul-searching and hard work, came back and did exactly what he said he was going to do.\" Vaughan: added: \"This was his best Test-match innings.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Pakistan batted for only 63 overs in the first innings and 70 in the second on a pitch that offered the bowlers little assistance. \"Their spirit was broken,\" said former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott. \"Full marks to England - they got it all together, the quality of the batting, the discipline, their good bowling. \"England are in a good place and will win again.

His mother, Diane, has been overwhelmed by the support and friendship he has received, with over 5,000 friend requests, 19,000 hits on his page, and hundreds of requests to visit places with the torch.

The timeline of the pregnancy is notably condensed, with Demelza going from announcing her pregnancy to being eight months pregnant and giving birth within a single episode. This quick progression of pregnancy is not new to the show, as a similar situation occurred with another character, Elizabeth, in a previous storyline.

The official number is 272, but experts believe the actual count could be higher. Research suggests that at least 1% of babies born in the UK may suffer from learning, behavioral, and physical disabilities due to prenatal alcohol exposure. This equates to around 7,500 babies annually. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a lifelong condition, and affected children often require assistance with daily tasks and struggle with cognitive and physical impairments. The World Health Organization's research highlights the severity of the issue, and experts advocate for stricter guidelines to discourage alcohol consumption during pregnancy.",

Experts warn that the actual number of affected children could be much higher. Research suggests that at least 1 in 100 babies born in the UK (approximately 7,500 per year) may suffer from learning, behavioural, and physical problems due to maternal alcohol consumption. Children born with FAS do not get better and may require lifelong care, as seen in the case of 15-year-old Niamh Brown. The condition can lead to a range of medical issues, including problems with the liver, kidneys, heart, and sight loss. The government advises pregnant women not to drink, with a recommended maximum consumption of up to 2 units, no more than twice a week, but some experts believe the guidance should be strengthened to advise complete abstinence during pregnancy.",

    "summary": "The passage reveals that 272 children in England were hospitalized in the past year due to being born with brain damage caused by exposure to alcohol in the womb. However, experts warn that the actual number of affected children could be much higher. Research by the World Health Organization suggests that approximately 1 in 100 babies born in the UK could suffer from learning, behavioral, and physical problems due to alcohol exposure, which amounts to around 7,500 babies each year. The passage also highlights the story of a teenager named Niamh Brown, who was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and requires assistance with daily tasks and will never be able to live independently. Other medical issues associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy are mentioned, including problems with the liver, kidneys, heart, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. Pregnant women are advised by the government to limit alcohol consumption, but some experts argue that the guidance should be changed to advise against drinking altogether during pregnancy.",

    "summary": "Hundreds of children were hospitalized last year in England due to brain damage from foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), with 272 cases reported, though the actual number may be higher. Research indicates that at least one in 100 UK babies could suffer from learning, behavioral, and physical problems due to prenatal alcohol exposure, equating to about 7,500 affected babies annually. Elizabeth Mitchell from the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome highlights the severity and under-diagnosis of the issue. A case example is 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who has severe disabilities due to FAS. The government advises pregnant women to limit alcohol intake, but some experts, like Mitchell, advocate for complete abstinence during pregnancy.",

    "source": "The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place. But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. \"Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,\" she said. \"We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. \"It would be more heartbreak than humiliation. \"Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. \"Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,\" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. \" It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. \"I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead. \"With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. \"Iceland are top seeds in the group,\" Evans noted. \" They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. \"But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. \"It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference. \"Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. \"It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,\" she recalled. \" There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. \"We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. \"I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us. \"Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. \"Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,\" she added. \"The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. \"Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. \"The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. \"It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.\"",
    "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information:\n\nThe Scottish women's national football team is close to qualifying for their first major tournament, the Euro 2017 finals in the Netherlands. They have won all five qualifiers so far and are preparing to host Iceland in a crucial match. Forward Lisa Evans emphasizes the importance of qualifying after previous near-misses. Iceland is also unbeaten in their group, and the upcoming matches between the two teams are likely to determine the group winner. \n\nThe Scottish team includes 12 players who play professionally outside of Scotland, including Evans, who recently won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich. Evans believes that having players in top international leagues benefits the national team by exposing them to different playing styles and higher levels of competition. The team is hoping for strong fan support at their upcoming match in Falkirk as they aim to secure their place in the Euro 2017 finals.",

But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. \"Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,\" she said. \"We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. \"It would be more heartbreak than humiliation. \"Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. \"Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,\" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. \" It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. \"I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead. \"With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. \"Iceland are top seeds in the group,\" Evans noted. \" They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. \"But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. \"It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference. \"Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. \"It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,\" she recalled. \" There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. \"We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. \"I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us. \"Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. \"Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,\" she added. \"The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. \"Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. \"The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. \"It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.\"",
    "summary": "The Scots have won all five qualifiers and will host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium, where a win would almost guarantee their place in the finals. Despite previous play-off losses, the team is determined to avoid another heartbreak. Iceland, ranked 20th in the world, is also undefeated. The match on Friday and the return fixture in Reykjavik on September 20 could determine the group winner. Scotland is in a strong position to qualify for the 2017 Women's European Championship in the Netherlands without needing a play-off. The team includes 12 players from outside Scotland, with many playing in top leagues like England, Sweden, and the United States.",

Forward Lisa Evans, who plays for Bayern Munich, is desperate to avoid missing out on a major tournament after previous play-off losses. The team is currently top of their group with five wins from five, while Iceland is also unbeaten. The outcome of the two teams' matches against each other will likely decide who tops the group.

    "source": "The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place. But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. \"Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,\" she said. \"We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. \"It would be more heartbreak than humiliation. \"Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. \"Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,\" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. \" It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. \"I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead. \"With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. \"Iceland are top seeds in the group,\" Evans noted. \" They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. \"But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. \"It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference. \"Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. \"It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,\" she recalled. \" There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. \"We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. \"I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us. \"Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. \"Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,\" she added. \"The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. \"Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. \"The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. \"It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.\"",
    "summary": "The Scots women's football team has won all five of their qualifiers and is set to host Iceland, knowing a victory would nearly secure their place in the finals. Forward Evans, who has experienced past play-off losses, emphasizes the importance of this opportunity. Iceland, ranked just above Scotland, is also unbeaten, making the upcoming matches crucial for determining the group leader. Evans, along with other players, highlights the emotional significance of reaching the finals and the advantage of having a strong fan presence. The team benefits from having players in top international leagues, which enhances their skills and competitiveness. Evans, who recently won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich, notes the positive impact of international experience on the national team.",

As Sunday night’s latest heartthrob, women across the country have voiced their longing to settle down with the brooding Cornish gentleman – but unfortunately it seems as if his heart is well and truly off the market. Scroll down for video . Last week she was barely showing – but Demelza Poldark is now the proud mother to the show’s latest addition . He may have married his red-headed kitchen maid out of duty, but as he tells her that she makes him a better man, audiences can have little doubt about his feelings. What is rather less convincing, however, is the timeline of the pregnancy. With the climax of the previous episode being the announcement of the pregnancy, it is quite a jump to the start of tomorrow’s instalment where Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant. Just minutes after – once again without any nod to the passing of time – she is giving birth, with the last month of her pregnancy passing in less than the blink of an eye. With the climax of the previous episode being the announcement of the pregnancy, it is quite a jump to the start of tomorrow’s instalment where Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant . As Sunday night’s latest heartthrob, women across the country have voiced their longing to settle down with Poldark – but unfortunately it seems as if his heart is well and truly off the market . Their fast relationship didn't go unnoticed by fans. One posted on Twitter: ‘If you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes’ It is reminiscent of the show’s previous pregnancy that saw Elizabeth, another contender for Ross’s affection, go to full term in the gap between two episodes. This didn’t go unnoticed by fans, who posted on Twitter: ‘Poldark is rather good, would watch the next one now. Though if you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes.’",
    "summary": " The passage discusses the Poldark TV show and its latest addition, a new baby girl born to the character Demelza Poldark, played by Eleanor Tomlinson. The timeline of Demelza's pregnancy is questionable, as she goes from barely showing to eight months pregnant within a short timeframe in the show. Ross Poldark, played by Aidan Turner, is shown to be in love with Demelza, but it is mentioned that his heart seems to be off the market. The fast pace of pregnancies in the show has been noted by fans, who have commented on social media. The passage also mentions that Ross Poldark is a popular heartthrob among women.",

In the upcoming episode, Ross Poldark is seen with his newborn daughter, despite Demelza barely showing in the previous episode. The timeline of the pregnancy is notably condensed, with Demelza going from announcing her pregnancy to being eight months pregnant and giving birth within a single episode. This quick progression of pregnancy is not new to the show, as a similar situation occurred with another character, Elizabeth, in a previous storyline. Fans have noticed and commented on social media about the unrealistically fast pregnancies in the show. Despite the timeline issues, the episode portrays Ross's deep affection for Demelza, suggesting their relationship has grown beyond duty.",

    "summary": "The passage describes a shocking incident where an aeroplane landed on a runway without deploying its landing gear and skidded along the runway on its belly. The video footage shows the plane approaching the landing strip normally until the observer realizes that the landing gear is not deployed. The plane touches down with a bump and scratches along the tarmac, damaging the propellers. The pilot then re-engages the engines and takes off back into the air. The video maker expresses concern that the pilot may crash due to the damage. However, the pilot manages to fly 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale and lands safely. The most common cause of such incidents is human error or mechanical faults. The FAA is investigating the incident.",

    "summary": "A light general aviation aircraft in Fort Pierce, Florida, landed without deploying its landing gear, skidding along the runway on its belly. The incident was captured on video, showing the plane's propellers hitting the ground and the wings bouncing. The pilot, Chris Georgaklis, 85, managed to re-engage the engines and take off again, flying 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale where he landed safely. The video maker noted the unforgettable sound of the propellers hitting the runway and expressed amazement that the engines were not destroyed.

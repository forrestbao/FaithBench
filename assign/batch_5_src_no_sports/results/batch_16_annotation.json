    "summary": "he passage describes the sixth significant fight in boxing history, Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao, which is anticipated to be the most financially successful and significant fight of the century. The summary focuses on the Sugar Ray Leonard vs Roberto Duran trilogy, considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middleweights. \n\nIn their first fight, Duran outpointed Leonard in Montreal, leading to a controversial result. In the second fight, Leonard used his speed and movement to frustrate Duran, who eventually quit in the eighth round, saying \"no mas.\" This event was met with shock and disbelief, as Duran was known for his heroic and tough fighting style. It took Duran three years to rebuild his reputation, which he did by knocking out Davey Moore in 1983 to win the world light-middleweight title. \n\nIn their third fight, Leonard retained the world super-middleweight title by a points landslide. Leonard took most pride from the trilogy for forcing Duran to say \"no mas.\" The passage suggests that the outcome of the Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight will determine its ranking among the most",

    "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information:\n\nThe passage discusses the significance of the Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Duran fights in boxing history. It focuses on their second bout on November 25, 1980, in New Orleans. In their first fight, Duran won a controversial decision. For the rematch, Leonard changed his strategy, using his speed and movement to frustrate Duran. In the eighth round, Leonard's tactics and psychological pressure led Duran to quit, famously saying \"No mas\" (No more). This shocking outcome stunned the boxing world and temporarily damaged Duran's reputation in Panama. Leonard considered forcing Duran to quit a greater achievement than knocking him out. The passage also mentions their third fight in 1989, which Leonard won decisively. These fights were part of a series that shaped boxing history and marked the beginning of a golden age in the middleweight divisions.",

    "summary": "The passage discusses the significance of the Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight, predicting it will be the most financially lucrative and significant fight of the century. It then delves into the complexities of evaluating the greatest boxing matches, considering various factors beyond just the action in the ring. The passage highlights the historic fights between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, particularly focusing on their second fight in 1980 where Leonard's strategy led to Duran's infamous \"no mas\" moment, quitting in the eighth round. This event shocked the world and tarnished Duran's reputation, which he only managed to restore three years later by winning another title. Leonard, who won their third fight in 1989, considered making Duran quit a greater achievement than knocking him out.",

    "summary": "Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:\n\nRory McIlroy, the world number one golfer, believes it is \"unthinkable\" that he will not win the Masters at some point to complete his career grand slam. He is hoping to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles. McIlroy has had a disappointing record at the Masters, with only one top-10 finish in six appearances, but he is confident that he can do well at the course. He is looking forward to the tournament, which starts on March 19, and hopes to use the golf course as his \"sanctuary\" from the pressure and hype surrounding Augusta. McIlroy has spoken about how his final-round collapse at the 2011 Masters was a turning point in his career, and he is hoping to learn from that experience and go on to win multiple majors, including the Masters.",

He believes that winning all four major titles is a significant achievement, as it requires success on different courses and under different conditions. McIlroy is confident in his ability to win at Augusta, despite his past struggles there, including a final-round collapse in 2011. He views that experience as a valuable learning opportunity, which helped him to win his first major title at the US Open two months later.

    "summary": "Rory McIlroy believes it is unthinkable that he will not win the Masters at some point to complete the career grand slam. He considers his final-round collapse at Augusta National in 2011 as the most important day of his career. McIlroy is aiming to become the sixth player to win all four major titles. He has just one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances but is determined to win a green jacket. McIlroy sees Augusta as a course he can do well on and hopes to win multiple times. He learned a lot from his collapse in 2011 and bounced back to win his first major title two months later. McIlroy's success last year came despite personal distractions. He sees the golf course as his sanctuary and hopes to use it to escape the pressure and hype surrounding Augusta.",

    "summary": " three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, one of the most expensive areas in Britain, is being sold for £575,000, significantly lower than the average price of neighboring homes. The property, located in Egerton Place, has only three years left on its lease. Despite the low price, the apartment's value could potentially increase to £6 million if the lease is extended. The property, described as 'bright and well proportioned,' requires modernization and has a living room in need of renovation. The current freeholder is the Welcome Trust, and extending the lease could cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million. The apartment has a history dating back to 1893 and has previously housed notable residents. However, potential buyers should be aware of the significant cost associated with extending the lease.",

    "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the passage:\n\nA three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, one of Britain's most expensive areas, is on sale for £575,000. This price is significantly lower than neighboring properties, but there's a catch: the lease has only three years remaining. The cost equates to about £15,000 per month, similar to renting in the area. If the buyer extends the lease, the property could be worth over £6 million. The 1,990 sq/ft \"unmodernised\" maisonette needs renovation but offers amenities like a lift, parking, and communal garden. It's one of two similar properties for sale on Egerton Place. Estate agents report high interest despite the upcoming election. Extending the lease to 90 years could cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million. Experts warn potential buyers about the significant cost of extending the lease and advise checking lease terms carefully.",

    "summary": "A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, is on the market for a significantly lower price than similar properties in the area. The flat is located in Egerton Place, an exclusive area known for its high-quality architecture. The property is described as bright and well-proportioned, with ample space and desirable features. However, the lease on the apartment is only three years, which makes it a risky investment. The current lease cost is around the same as renting in the area, but extending the lease could be very expensive, potentially costing millions. Despite the catch, the property has generated a lot of interest due to its bargain price and potential value.",

    "summary": "A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, is on the market for £575,000, a fraction of the price of neighboring homes. However, the property has only three years left on its lease. While the cost works out to be around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area, extending the lease could make the property worth upwards of £6 million. The apartment is in need of renovation, but boasts 1,990 sq/ft of space, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, and a utility room. Estate agents say it is rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market, and the phone has been ringing off the hook about the apartment. However, potential buyers should be aware that extending the lease will come with a massive premium. \n",

    "summary": "A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London is on the market for £575,000, significantly cheaper than neighboring properties. However, the catch is that the lease only has three years remaining. The cost of the lease would be £191,000 per year or £15,000 per month, which is similar to the rental rate in the area. If the buyer decides to extend the lease, the property could be worth over £6 million. The apartment is described as \"bright and well proportioned\" with 1,990 sq/ft of space and includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, utility room, lift, parking, and a communal garden. The property needs renovation. Another larger property in the same area is also on the market for £595,000 with three years remaining on the lease. The next cheapest three-bedroom property in Knightsbridge costs £1.5 million with a 28-year lease. The current freeholder is the Welcome Trust, and negotiating a lease extension is estimated to cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million for a 90-year lease.",

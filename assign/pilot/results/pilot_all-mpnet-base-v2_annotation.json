    "source": "The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role. Leyton Orient interim manager Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device \"For me to lose two managers this season has been very tough and I've found it very hard this week. \" We had to be professional, we're here to do a job and if I wasn't professional then I wouldn't be true to myself. \" We owe it to the fans. At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club. \" We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs.\" Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: \"I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline. \" If you haven't got organisation and you haven't got the discipline to play 90 minutes, the outcome is inevitable. \" Dagenham over the years are going to get beat, it's responding to that that the club's not been able to do this year.\"",
    "summary": "The passage describes a crucial football match between Dagenham & Redbridge (The Daggers) and Leyton Orient (The O's) with significant implications for both teams. Dagenham, facing relegation, needed a win to maintain their League Two status, while Orient aimed to secure a play-off spot. The game saw a thrilling comeback from Dagenham, who initially conceded two goals but fought back to level the score. However, Armand Gnanduillet's winner for Orient sealed Dagenham's fate, relegating them to the National League. This result highlights Dagenham's struggles throughout the season, with a poor goal difference and a less productive attack compared to previous years. Despite the setback, Dagenham's manager, John Still, expressed his commitment to leading the team back to promotion next season. Meanwhile, Orient's interim manager, Andy Hessenthaler, acknowledged the challenges of losing two managers in a season but emphasized the team's professionalism and dedication to winning for their fans.",

    "summary": "An explosion at a chemical plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, China, injured six people and caused a large fire. The plant produces paraxylene (PX), a carcinogenic chemical used in polyester production. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility due to an oil leak, but no toxic chemical spill was reported. Five of the injured were hurt by broken glass and hospitalized. Over 600 firefighters controlled the blaze. The plant had a previous explosion in 2013 without casualties or toxic leaks. The construction of PX plants has led to protests in China, and this plant was relocated from Xiamen to a more remote area due to pollution concerns.",

But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. \"Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,\" she said. \"We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. \"It would be more heartbreak than humiliation. \"Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. \"Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,\" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. \" It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. \"I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead. \"With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. \"Iceland are top seeds in the group,\" Evans noted. \" They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. \"But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. \"It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference. \"Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. \"It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,\" she recalled. \" There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. \"We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. \"I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us. \"Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. \"Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,\" she added. \"The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. \"Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. \"The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. \"It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.\"",
    "summary": "The Scottish women's football team is on the cusp of qualifying for a major tournament, needing a win against Iceland to secure their spot. This is a significant opportunity after previous near-misses in play-offs. The team is confident, with a strong record in qualifiers and a mix of domestic and international talent, including players from top leagues in England, Sweden, and the US. The match will be emotional, with a potential large home crowd at Falkirk Stadium. The squad's experience in foreign leagues, like Germany's Bundesliga, is seen as a boost to their competitiveness and a sign of the sport's growth in Scotland.",

The advertisements have been placed on the London Underground and have received significant backlash from feminists, body image campaigners, and social media users who find the campaign offensive, unrealistic, and sexist. The advertisements have been defaced, and a Change.org petition calling for their removal has gathered over 50,000 signatures. \n\nTransport for London (TFL) has confirmed that the posters will be removed because they have come to the end of the three-week advertising period that Protein World paid for. TFL has also received over 200 complaints from people saying that the adverts promote an unhealthy body image. Protein World has defended the campaign, claiming that the image is unphotoshopped and that the campaign is targeted at health-conscious individuals looking to get fit in time for summer. \n\nThe controversy has also attracted the attention of TV personalities such as Susanna Reid, who described the campaign as \"anxiety-inducing\" during",

scoreline after a tammy abraham double had seen chelsea take a first half lead . \nsportsmail was at the academy stadium to see how the youngsters got on ...\ntammy abraham smashes chelsea into the lead with a fierce drive into the top corner\nkjetil haug : norwegian international has been on the bench for long periods but got the nod and looked shaky under the high ball . \nthat said , powerless to stop abraham 's volleys and soalnke 's killer . \npablo maffeo : barcelona-born former espanyol youngster is not the tallest and at times struggled with chelsea 's diagonals early on but grew into the game and could have levelled . \ntosin adarabioyo : manchester lad and england youth international , city 's captain was a commanding presence at the heart of defence . \nhas the movement of yaya toure but put a big shift in . \nchristian haug goes up for the ball under pressure from chelsea forwards during the youth cup final\ncameron humphreys-grant : has captained england and , like adarabioyo had his hands full against a vibrant chelsea attack but stood up to the test well . \njose angelino tasende : spanish left-back is not the tallest and was not able to drive forward as much as he would have liked against strong opposition . \nkean bryan : box-to-box midfielder from beswick , yards away from the etihad stadium , pulled up injured after 36 minutes but battled back bravely but missed a glorious chance to tie things up . \nmanchester city midfielder kean bryan tracks the run of dominic solanke as city looked to stem the tide\naaron nemane : moved to manchester from france as a toddler , the wide man who scored twice in the first leg of the semi final did outwitted dasilva with a delightful tap and go but could not find the final , killer ball . \nblasted wide when should have levelled . \nbersant celina : kosovan international celina struggled to fill in for injured star thierry ambrose , seeing one shot from the edge of the area easily held by collins . \nmanu garcia : joined city from sporting gijon and the mini david silva showed some neat touches on the rare occasions he found space . \nwas largely ineffective and should have done better when teed up by barker late on . \nmanuel garcia gets a shot away , but it was blocked by jake clarke-salter\nisaac buckley-ricketts : pacy mancunian centre forward produced measured finish to bring city level but was marshalled well for the majority of the evening . \nbrandon barker : city 's star man , the two-footed local lad is tipped for big things at the etihad but was perhaps guilty of trying to do too much at times here . \ndid create a fine chance for garcia with a trademark surge and almost levelled late on . \ncity 's players celebrate after isaac buckley ( left ) had levelled the game in the first half\nbradley collins : the southampton-born stopper could do little about city 's opener and distributed the ball well . \nfikayo tomori : canadian born but eligible for england combined well with clarke-salter to nullify city 's threat in a commanding-looking partnership . \nola aina : england under-19 right-back found space time and time again down the right . \nquick , strong and often influential . \njake clarke-salter : england under 18s international often too strong for buckley-ricketts and , on the evidence of this sterling performance , is one to watch . \njay dasilva : under-21 regular is still 16 . \nfortunate to escape at least a caution with a from-behind challenge in the first half but was solid at the back and lively going forward , whipping in a number of decent crosses . \nruben sammut : scottish youth international covered his back four expertly and kickstarted a number of breaks as city pressed . \nruben sammut plays the ball out in an excellent performance protecting the back four\ntammy abraham : two volleys for his 35th and 36th strikes of the season . \nbig , bold and often brilliant , chelsea will be hoping the injury that saw him substituted on 67 minutes is not serious . \ncharlie colkett : put in a captain 's shift in the centre of the park as the visitors won the midfield battle . \nis tipped for big things and showed just why . \nabraham makes it 2-1 at the academy stadium with an acrobatic finish past christian haug\ndominic solanke : scored for england in the european under-17 championship final and put in a powerful shift here , teaming up well with abraham before effectively killing the tie with a neat third . \ncharly musonda : the belgian playmaker , the only overseas man in the starting xi , was quiet by his standards and drilled a decent chance tamely wide . \nisaiah brown : said to be interesting jose mourinho but will not want to dwell on his big moment early on when he blasted over bar when unmarked on the edge of the box . \nmiss aside , was a constant menace . \nkasey palmer ( abraham , 67 , 35 ) : on for abraham and showed explosive pace straight away but was let down by a hurried attempt at a finish which flew over the bar . \nisaiah brown holds off a tackle from fikayo tomori , during another impressive display for the young forward",

    "source": "The \"black box\" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats. Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing. Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit. An analysis is expected to be released next week. The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response. Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace. Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of \"creeping Islamisation\". What we know about how the Su-24 was downedHow Russia's sanctions could hit TurkeyThe war of words as it eruptedThe two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group. The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November. Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued. A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground. Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars.",

But the site limits friend associations to 5,000 per personal page and he cannot accept all the requests. Flanked by hundreds of people, he walked for nearly half an hour with the Olympic torch with an assistant who supported his arm. L/Bdr Parkinson's nomination stated: \"The brain injury took his speech, but not his personality and sense of humour,\" adding he now speaks unaided. It said: \"Determined to prove everyone wrong, he fought back every step of the way. Ben's intelligence and wit [are] unchanged. Still the same funny and caring Ben.\" He spends 12 hours a day in the gym and rehab and walks with crutches, spending \"the rest of his time spent raising money for many military charities and as patron of his beloved             Pilgrim Bandits \". L/Bdr Parkinson's mother Diane said the responses had \"been phenomenal\" and that Ben was really \"buoyed up\" by the support and friendship he had been shown. She said: \"It's just unbelievable, Ben's had way over 5,000 friend requests but Facebook won't let him have more than that number. \" Thousands of people have joined the Pilgrim Bandits website and the messages of support we've had are great. \" Ben's page has had 19,000 hits just on an update, I don't understand how these things work, but it's phenomenal.\" She said the amount of post the family had received had also increased. She added: \"Some mail has just been addressed to Ben, please Mr Postie. \" E-mail traffic has gone through the roof and Ben's had hundreds of requests to visit places with the [Olympic] torch. \" He's absolutely bouncing and buoyed up and elated.\" Facebook would not comment on the issue but their guidance was that if people were receiving this many requests then they have become a public figure, so should consider having a page instead of a profile. Alternatively, Ben could use subscribe so that people can see his public updates without actually becoming a friend. A total of 8,000 people will carry the flame during its 8,000 mile, 70-day journey to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on 27 July.",

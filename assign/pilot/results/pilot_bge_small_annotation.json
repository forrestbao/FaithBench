England made 589-8 declared and 173-1 declared to set up their second biggest win over Pakistan in terms of runs. \" It's an absolute hammering. It's as good a four days of cricket that you could wish for from an England point of view,\" Vaughan told Test Match Special. England's Joe Root, promoted to number three for this series, was named man of the match after scoring 254 in the first innings and an unbeaten 71 off 48 balls in the second. He also took four catches in Pakistan's first-innings 198 and claimed a wicket in his only over as Pakistan were bowled out for 234 on Monday. \" It's great to see him stepping up to number three and playing with the responsibility there,\" said captain Alastair Cook, who made 105 and 76 not out. \" It's as good an innings as I've seen. He's an extraordinary player. He didn't put a foot wrong; he played beautifully.\" Root, who twice fell to poor strokes in England's 75-run defeat in the first Test, said: \"It's a great feeling. \" Those two occasions at Lord's were batsman error on my part. I tried to cut that out of my game. It's the most controlled I've played.\" Coach Trevor Bayliss said: \"He went away and did a bit of soul-searching and hard work, came back and did exactly what he said he was going to do.\" Vaughan: added: \"This was his best Test-match innings.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Pakistan batted for only 63 overs in the first innings and 70 in the second on a pitch that offered the bowlers little assistance. \" Their spirit was broken,\" said former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott. \" Full marks to England - they got it all together, the quality of the batting, the discipline, their good bowling. \" England are in a good place and will win again. They will be too strong for Pakistan. I'll be surprised if they come back.\" Pakistan play a two-day tour game against Worcestershire at New Road starting on Friday before the third Test at Edgbaston gets under way on 3 August. Media playback is not supported on this device Vaughan said: \"England should enjoy the win and have a good party, but I just have a feeling that this series is going to be very, very tight.\" Of the Pakistan players, only captain Misbah-ul-Haq and Asad Shafiq have passed 50 in the first two Tests of the four-match series. \" This is a big disappointment for us,\" said Misbah. \" We could have scored around 400 in the first innings - the ball wasn't doing anything much. \" We are short of confidence and shot selection really cost us. \" These guys are strong characters - mentally strong. I'm hopeful that everybody is hurt and they will really work hard.\" Media playback is not supported on this device",

    "summary": "The passage discusses Manuel Pellegrini's disappointment in Yaya Toure's performance this season. Pellegrini acknowledges that Toure has underperformed but states that he will continue to support him until the end of the season. It is revealed that Manchester City would listen to offers for Toure in the summer as they plan to overhaul their squad. The passage also mentions that Vincent Kompany could miss the rest of the season due to a muscle injury. Joe Hart, the City goalkeeper, takes responsibility for the team's poor performances and expresses support for Pellegrini. Additionally, Sam Allardyce warns Aaron Cresswell, a West Ham left back, not to make the same mistake as other English players by moving to Manchester City.",

    "source": "Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance. Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies. The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge. The win lifted Mick McCarthy's Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: \"The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three. \" With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team. \" We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been.\" QPR boss Ian Holloway:  \"I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn't have. \" The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five. \" Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him. Even with my legs, I would have ran back and tried to help him. \" My players need to be mentally tougher as a group. I am disappointed with how we finished today. We have got to try and be a bigger, braver and more solid team.\" Match ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Second Half ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Attempt saved.

    "summary": " In this passage, Ipswich Town defeated Queens Park Rangers (QPR) 3-0 in a Championship match. The goals were scored by Grant Ward, Luke Varney (after a QPR keeper's miscue), and Tom Lawrence. Ipswich had several other opportunities to score but failed to convert. QPR offered little in attack and had a late chance when Sandro headed a corner against the post. Ipswich had struggled to score in recent games, but this win lifted them up four places to 14th, while QPR slipped to 15th. Mick McCarthy, Ipswich's manager, praised his team's performance, particularly Luke Varney, while Ian Holloway, QPR's manager, criticized his team's mental toughness and defensive play. The passage also details several unsuccessful attempts at scoring by both teams.",

    "source": "Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance. Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies. The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge. The win lifted Mick McCarthy's Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: \"The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three. \" With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team. \" We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been.\" QPR boss Ian Holloway:  \"I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn't have. \" The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five. \" Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him. Even with my legs, I would have ran back and tried to help him. \" My players need to be mentally tougher as a group. I am disappointed with how we finished today. We have got to try and be a bigger, braver and more solid team.\" Match ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Second Half ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Attempt saved.

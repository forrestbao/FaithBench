IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30.

The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","summary":"On January 20, 2017, militants armed with guns and grenades attacked a hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT) when one militant detonated explosives at the hospital gate, allowing the others to enter and open fire on staff and patients. Commandos landed on the hospital roof and killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack, while the Taliban denied any involvement. The attack resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people and wounded more than 50. This attack marks a change in approach by IS fighters in Afghanistan, as it is the first time they have directly engaged with security forces in the capital. Previously, they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. The attack suggests that IS now has the resources and military training to expand its attacks. \n","model":"google\/gemini-1.5-flash-001","HHEMv1":0.57577,"HHEM-2.1":0.09072,"HHEM-2.1-English":0.0673,"trueteacher":1,"true_nli":1.0,"gpt-3.5-turbo":1,"gpt-4-turbo":0,"gpt-4o":0,"sample_id":841}

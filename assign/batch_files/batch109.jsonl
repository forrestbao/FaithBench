Depay is currently enjoying a prolific season at PSV, scoring 20 goals in 26 league games, and is worth more than the \u00a315 million offer rejected by PSV from Tottenham last summer. PSV's technical director has confirmed that United, Paris-Saint Germain, and a third European club have made contact with PSV regarding Depay. Depay started his career at VV Moordrecht before joining Sparta Rotterdam and then PSV at the age of 12. He has already made over 100 appearances for PSV and is known for his pace, close control, and ability to dribble past defenders. He has been compared to Dutch star Arjen Robben and even Cristiano Ronaldo by some.","model":"mistralai\/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3","HHEMv1":0.37099,"HHEM-2.1":0.9386,"HHEM-2.1-English":0.96988,"trueteacher":1,"true_nli":1.0,"gpt-3.5-turbo":1,"gpt-4-turbo":1,"gpt-4o":1,"sample_id":102}

Depay is praised for his dribbling skills, goal-scoring ability, and potential to develop into a player comparable to Arjen Robben or Cristiano Ronaldo.","model":"Qwen\/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct","HHEMv1":0.46422,"HHEM-2.1":0.90777,"HHEM-2.1-English":0.94116,"trueteacher":1,"true_nli":1.0,"gpt-3.5-turbo":1,"gpt-4-turbo":1,"gpt-4o":1,"sample_id":562}

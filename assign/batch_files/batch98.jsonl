The fight was part of the \"Golden Age of Boxing\" in the classic middleweight division, featuring Leonard, Duran, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler. The first fight between Leonard and Duran was contentious, with Duran winning by a narrow margin, but the rematch in 1980 saw Leonard use his speed and movement to outmaneuver Duran, who became increasingly frustrated and ultimately quit in the 8th round, famously saying \"No Mas.\" The result stunned the watching world and took three years for Duran to rebuild his reputation. Leonard took pride in making Duran quit, considering it a greater achievement than knocking him out.","model":"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct","HHEMv1":0.77951,"HHEM-2.1":0.86292,"HHEM-2.1-English":0.96994,"trueteacher":1,"true_nli":1.0,"gpt-3.5-turbo":1,"gpt-4-turbo":1,"gpt-4o":1,"sample_id":648}

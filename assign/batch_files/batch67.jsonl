Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role. Leyton Orient interim manager Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device \"For me to lose two managers this season has been very tough and I've found it very hard this week. \"We had to be professional, we're here to do a job and if I wasn't professional then I wouldn't be true to myself. \"We owe it to the fans. At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club. \"We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs.\" Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: \"I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline. \"If you haven't got organisation and you haven't got the discipline to play 90 minutes, the outcome is inevitable. \"Dagenham over the years are going to get beat, it's responding to that that the club's not been able to do this year.\"","summary":"The Daggers, who joined League One in 2010, needed a win to maintain their survival hopes but were relegated after a 3-2 loss to Leyton Orient. Despite goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona, Armand Gnanduillet's winner sealed their fate. Dagenham, who first entered the Football League in 2007, will return to the National League under manager John Still, who previously led them to League One. The team has struggled defensively and offensively this season, with a poor goal difference and fewer goals from key striker Jamie Cureton. Still, in his third spell as manager, is committed to helping the team gain promotion next season. Leyton Orient, now two points from the play-off spots, recently removed player-manager Kevin Nolan, with interim manager Andy Hessenthaler emphasizing professionalism and the importance of winning games for the fans.","model":"openai\/gpt-4o","HHEMv1":0.26473,"HHEM-2.1":0.1626,"HHEM-2.1-English":0.37137,"trueteacher":1,"true_nli":1.0,"gpt-3.5-turbo":1,"gpt-4-turbo":1,"gpt-4o":1,"sample_id":1074}

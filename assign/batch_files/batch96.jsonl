Heavy drinking is defined as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, while binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion. The study found that the increase in heavy drinking is largely driven by women's drinking habits as social norms change. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, and in 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers. Despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time. The study also notes that 88,600 U.S. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010, and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $220 billion per year.

The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park. The fourth-tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday, but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian. Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross.

Cheltenham, a League Two side, started brightly but were unable to capitalize on their chances, with Harry Pell and Jordon Forster coming close to scoring. West Ham made seven changes to their team following recent Premier League losses, and could have won by a greater margin if not for some good saves by Cheltenham goalkeeper Jonathan Flatt. The win ended League Two's representation in the EFL Cup, with Cheltenham exiting the competition.","model":"meta-llama\/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct","HHEMv1":0.32879,"HHEM-2.1":0.68358,"HHEM-2.1-English":0.64854,"trueteacher":1,"true_nli":1.0,"gpt-3.5-turbo":1,"gpt-4-turbo":1,"gpt-4o":1,"sample_id":723}
{"source":"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time.

The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post.

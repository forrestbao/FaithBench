{"source":"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with\u00a0a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors.

He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser.

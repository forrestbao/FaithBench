Granger befriended Hassan after seeing him with a large sum of money at a casino in London. She used her good looks to gain his trust and received gifts and money from him. Granger then went back to Hassan's flat with him one night and left the door unlocked for her boyfriend and an accomplice to enter. They tied up Hassan, kicked him to death, and ransacked his home for his hidden winnings. Granger was found guilty of manslaughter but not murder. Her co-defendants, Kyrron Jackson and Nicholas Chandler, were found guilty of murder and received life sentences. The judge described the attack as \"pitiless and wicked.\" Granger claimed she got involved in the plot because she was in love with Jackson. The court heard that Hassan was a \"soft target\" due to his fondness for women and his habit of keeping his winnings in his flat. The killers were caught after Granger's phone records were examined.","model":"openai\/GPT-3.5-Turbo","HHEMv1":0.44225,"HHEM-2.1":0.93557,"HHEM-2.1-English":0.98451,"trueteacher":1,"true_nli":1.0,"gpt-3.5-turbo":1,"gpt-4-turbo":1,"gpt-4o":1,"sample_id":997}

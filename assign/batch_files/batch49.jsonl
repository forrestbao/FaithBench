Six people were injured by broken glass and taken to the hospital. The fire, which occurred at an oil storage facility after an oil leak, is now under control after 600 firefighters were sent to extinguish it. The plant, which is reportedly carcinogenic, has a history of protests due to pollution concerns, and was relocated to a more remote location in 2007 following public backlash. The plant was previously slated for Xiamen, a densely populated city in southeast China. There was no mention of toxic chemical spills in this incident, but the plant has a history of explosions, with the last one occurring in July 2013.","model":"mistralai\/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3","HHEMv1":0.38864,"HHEM-2.1":0.96409,"HHEM-2.1-English":0.99177,"trueteacher":1,"true_nli":1.0,"gpt-3.5-turbo":1,"gpt-4-turbo":1,"gpt-4o":1,"sample_id":88}

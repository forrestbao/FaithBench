United's manager, Louis van Gaal, who previously worked with Depay during the 2014 World Cup, is keen to make him one of his first summer signings. Depay has had a prolific season, scoring 20 goals in 26 league games and helping PSV win their first Eredivisie title in seven years. Despite interest from other top European clubs, United are currently leading the race to sign him. Depay, known for his pace, dribbling, and powerful right-foot shots, has been compared to Arjen Robben and a young Cristiano Ronaldo. He has already made over 100 appearances for PSV and has been recognized for his performances at the World Cup.","model":"openai\/gpt-4o","HHEMv1":0.48958,"HHEM-2.1":0.9707,"HHEM-2.1-English":0.98833,"trueteacher":1,"true_nli":1.0,"gpt-3.5-turbo":1,"gpt-4-turbo":1,"gpt-4o":1,"sample_id":1142}

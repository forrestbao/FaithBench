It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London\\'s Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year\\'s shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as \"What Happened, If It Happened\". Mukherjee\\'s The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith\\'s How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005\\'s The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris\\'s third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia\\'s Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler\\'s We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris\\'s To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee\\'s The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. \"It\\'s a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,\" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. \"The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson\\'s J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel\\'s double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). \"John Sutherland\\'s mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won\\'t have helped its chances either. \"It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called \\'readable\\' books.\" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand\\'s Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner. The shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book.

Cole Skuse\\'s long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry\\'s corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies. The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway\\'s second game in charge. The win lifted Mick McCarthy\\'s Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: \"The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I\\'ll take three. \"With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren\\'t thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team. \"We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been.\" QPR boss Ian Holloway:  \"I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn\\'t have. \"The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five. \"Everyone will blame my keeper but I won\\'t as my defenders should have made an angle for him. Even with my legs, I would have ran back and tried to help him. \"My players need to be mentally tougher as a group. I am disappointed with how we finished today. We have got to try and be a bigger, braver and more solid team.\" Match ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Second Half ends, Ipswich Town 3, Queens Park Rangers 0. Attempt saved.

The defendant, now 34 and called Davina, denied the charge. She will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody and said it was likely she would be held at a male prison. He added: \"If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason. \"I will therefore have to remand in custody. It will have to be a male prison in Winchester but it will be an issue for the prison service.\" He also told the jury at Portsmouth Crown Court: \"It\\'s been a slightly unusual case and it\\'s not been an easy case.\" The court heard that Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, attempted to commit suicide last summer. Protocols have been put in place for her detention at the prison, a court officer explained. During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not \"made any physical changes or enhancements\" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage.

Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia\\'s Rostov region - bordering Ukraine\\'s eastern separatist regions. \"I gave all this data to Ukraine\\'s security service, but they still can\\'t get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. \"DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops\\' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine\\'s security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group\\'s declared goal is thwarting Ukraine\\'s military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America\\'s behest. Its motto is \"We won\\'t forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden\\'s visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists\\' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden\\'s team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington\\'s military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October\\'s parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko\\'s website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia\\'s domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors\\' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn\\'t. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg\\'s try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg\\'s hands. Away he went for Scotland\\'s fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia\\'s scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price\\'s shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland\\'s sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: \"It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn\\'t access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. \"In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren\\'t as neat and quick as we\\'d like. And they were very good over the ball. \"But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. \"I think there\\'s been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)\\'s done a great job in that with his guys around him.

Yorkshire\\'s run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord\\'s for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: \"Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody\\'s pulling together. \"Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. \"The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. \"But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs.\" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: \"We are all gutted.

Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with\\xa0a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series.

The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L\\'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy\\'s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor \"came out of nowhere\", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - \"medium-strong\" and \"fairly shallow\". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L\\'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement. The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided \"inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory\" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake. At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L\\'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely. On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.', 'Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari\\'s Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen\\'s rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari\\'s decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg\\'s points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel\\'s path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber\\'s Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen\\'s damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: \"If I don\\'t go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo.\" Kvyat replied: \"We didn\\'t crash.\" Vettel responded: \"You didn\\'t. You were lucky this time.\" Kvyat shrugged: \"I\\'m on the podium; you\\'re on the podium.\" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: \"You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium.\" Listen to Vettel\\'s post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg\\'s front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. \"The car was pretty damaged,\" said the 31-year-old afterwards. \"I\\'m sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place.\" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a \"lot of aerodynamic performance\". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was \"staggered\" by the \"incomprehensible\" decision to remove the sport\\'s funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has \"confirmed its commitment\" for Tokyo 2020. He added: \"These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained.\" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men\\'s doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a \"catastrophic impact on the sport\" and Badminton England would \"fight for the hopes and dreams\" of its players. \"How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?\" he said. \"What have we done wrong?\" added GB Badminton\\'s performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. \"We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,\" she said. \"If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk.\" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: \"UK Sport\\'s approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020.\" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build \"performance pathways for future success\" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: \"It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. \"With UK Sport\\'s investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport.\" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined \"following further exploration of medal potential\", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: \"The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I\\'m pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. \"We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.\"', \"Rage Against the Machine .

Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season.

Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: \"He\\'s a brilliant number nine. He won\\'t need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he\\'ll get goals. \"That\\'s the type of guy he is and on his game he\\'s a handful. I\\'m delighted for him. He\\'s earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he\\'ll do great for them. \"He\\'s going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well.\" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: \"He gives something different, a massive presence up front. \"It\\'s a fallacy when people say he doesn\\'t play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. \"He\\'s very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that\\'s something we haven\\'t had for some time up front. It\\'s something I\\'m really happy with and I think he\\'ll bring a lot to the squad. \"I\\'m a lot more optimistic than I was this time last year. The strikers only scored eight goals last year, we can only do better than that going forward.\" Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.', 'Charlie Austin\\'s sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas\\' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull\\'s first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull\\'s strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane\\'s injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers\\' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family\\'s running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass\\' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin\\'s early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies\\' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk\\'s looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel\\'s men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull\\'s slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: \"I\\'m really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. \"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. \"Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: \"We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation. \"After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future. \"We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.\" Following the international break, Hull return to action with a trip to bottom side Sunderland on Saturday, 19 November (15:00 GMT), while on the same day Southampton play host to leaders Liverpool, also at 15:00.

Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not \"feel cheated\" and had been \"very lucky\" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been \"a giant among journalists\" and the \"heart and soul\" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow\\'s Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: \"It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. \"Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all.\" He added: \"He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. \"Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him.\" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had \"an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. \"There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker\\'s gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy.\" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a \"controversialist\" but also \"a kind man and a brilliant writer\". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as \"the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times\". \"The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,\" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been \"the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style\". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. \"In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine.\" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: \"Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour.\" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had \"trashed\" him for 20 years, but always did so \"with magnificently eloquent savagery\" as well as \"an irritating kernel of truth\". While his writing remained popular, Gill\\'s articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as \"dark, ugly little trolls\" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as \"a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile\". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the \"hernia on the end of England\", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it \"smelled of boiled washing\". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding\\'s 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a \"dyke on a bike\". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay\\'s restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill\\'s illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been \"surprisingly excited\" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as \"The Blonde\" in his restaurant reviews.', '( cnn ) bobbi kristina brown , the daughter of bobby brown and whitney houston , has \" global and irreversible brain damage , \" according to her grandmother .\\nthough the 22-year-old is no longer in a medically induced coma , she remains unresponsive , cissy houston said in a statement monday after visiting her granddaughter .\\n\" meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me , \" houston said .\\n\" we can only trust in god for a miracle at this time . \"\\nhouston \\'s statement matched that from a source with knowledge of brown \\'s condition , who told cnn on monday that she remained in the same neurological state she has been in for nearly three months .\\nshe does not respond to visitors or familiar voices , and her eyes do not follow a person around the room , the source told cnn .\\nshe also has a tracheostomy in her throat , the source said .\\nthe reports come two days after brown \\'s father , bobby brown , said his daughter \\'s condition had improved .\\n\" i can say today , bobbi is awake .\\nshe \\'s watching me , \" brown told the audience at dallas \\' verizon theatre .\\nin a statement monday , an attorney for the brown family said that bobbi kristina brown \\'s condition has improved but that the kind of life she will lead remains to be seen .\\n\" doctors have indicated that she will have a long life , \" attorney christopher brown said .\\n\" however , bobbi kristina is presently embarking on a rehabilitation process , and the quality of her life will not be known for years to come . \"\\nwho \\'s who in the bobbi kristina brown case ?\\nbobby brown was in an \" emotional state \" on stage when he made the remarks about his daughter being awake , according to the statement .\\n\" she has made it out of icu , opened her eyes and started a rehabilitation that will be long and hard , \" said bobby brown \\'s wife , alicia etheredge-brown .', \"west ham are discussing a deal for jamaican starlet deshane beckford after he impressed on trial .\\nthe skilful 17-year-old forward from montego bay united was invited to train with west ham 's academy earlier this month and has impressed coaches after spending two weeks with the club .\\nbeckford also has offers from clubs in belgium .\\nbeckford , who has been linked with a host of european clubs , is said to be one of the hottest prospects to emerge from the caribbean .\\npremier league outfit west ham are closing in on the signature of jamaican starlet deshane beckford\\nmeanwhile , west ham have revealed season tickets at the olympic stadium will cost as little as £ 289 .\\nthe hammers will have the cheapest pricing strategy in the barclays premier league in a bid to fill the 54,000 capacity stadium when they make the switch for the 2016-17 season .\", \"west ham are discussing a deal for jamaican starlet deshane beckford after he impressed on trial .\\nthe skilful 17-year-old forward from montego bay united was invited to train with west ham 's academy earlier this month and has impressed coaches after spending two weeks with the club .\\nbeckford also has offers from clubs in belgium .\\nbeckford , who has been linked with a host of european clubs , is said to be one of the hottest prospects to emerge from the caribbean .\\npremier league outfit west ham are closing in on the signature of jamaican starlet deshane beckford\\nmeanwhile , west ham have revealed season tickets at the olympic stadium will cost as little as £ 289 .\\nthe hammers will have the cheapest pricing strategy in the barclays premier league in a bid to fill the 54,000 capacity stadium when they make the switch for the 2016-24 season .\", 'Josh Gillies beat Cameron Belford in the visitors\\' goal with a fine free-kick to put the Tynesiders ahead.

Fognini, the 29th seed, had five set points to force a fifth set but Murray won five games in a row to seal a place in the last 16 for the 11th time. Murray will play Frenchman Benoit Paire in the fourth round on Monday. Fellow Briton Johanna Konta earlier reached the second week for the first time with a 6-4 6-1 win over Maria Sakkari of Greece. Media playback is not supported on this device \"The end of the match was tense. It was an up and down match. I didn\\'t feel like it was the best tennis at times but I managed to get through,\" Murray told the BBC. \"It was getting dark towards the end and I was probably thinking a bit about that. \"We would have had to go off for the roof to go on, so that would have meant a change in conditions. I\\'m pleased to get off in four.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Murray looked like avoiding a long, drawn-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded. Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini\\'s challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray\\'s momentum as the champion served his way to victory. \"I feel OK,\" added Murray. \"I didn\\'t feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I\\'ve got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday. \"I\\'m happy to get through the first week and anything can happen from here on.\"', \"Tries from Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van and Chris Bridge gave Widnes a 14-6 half-time lead, with Cas loanee Paddy Flynn responding against his parent club. Flynn scored another early in the second, but Ah Van, Lloyd White (2) and Joe Mellor tries made it 38-12. Despite three Cas tries in four minutes - Larne Patrick, Luke Gale and Flynn's hat-trick score - Widnes held on. The Vikings' victory had looked assured when Mellor took advantage of Castleford indecision on a short kick-off, running straight through to help them to a 26-point lead. But, having lost nine of their previous 10 matches, their defence creaked as they let Patrick, who has just signed a three-year deal to move from Huddersfield after his loan spell, in for a try. Gale and Flynn - on loan at Castleford from the Vikings until the end of the season - made it a nervy finish, but the Tigers suffered their fourth consecutive home league defeat.

This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.\"To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,\" he said about whether he would extend his stay.\"No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.\"Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.\"Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of \"tension\" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank\\'s pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain\\'s economic future.', \"on the pitch this season , chelsea have been hitting their targets ... and off it , eden hazard and three of his blues team-mates have been doing the same . taking part in audi 's football challenge , hazard and nathan ake paired up to take on loic remy and willian in a head-to-head challenge for the car manufacturers . in round one , the chelsea stars aim to fire balls into the boot of a car from close range , with hazard and ake securing the points with a 5-3 win . one of the challenges the chelsea players were set was to sink balls into convertible audi 's from long range . 17-goal man eden hazard and youngster nathan ake took on blues ' team-mates loic remy and willian . from there , they take to a makeshift tennis court , where the net is replaced by a £127,000 audi r8 v10 plus , and the players must play over the top of it . once again , it is 17-goal man hazard and his partner ake who come up trumps , winning the decider to take a 6-0 lead after the first two rounds . it is in the final game that most points are won , as the players shoot from long range aiming to sink their footballs through the top of a convertible audi . hazard poses next to a £127,000 r8 v10 plus audi , which played the part of tennis net in one challenge . the final challenge involved the players shooting at cars from long range , with remy and willian winning . hazard throws footballs up to his team-mate ake , who tries to fire them into the boot of an audi . willian and remy redeem themselves to produce a shock win over their team-mates , but the pair were involved in the biggest misfortune of the day on their way to victory . shown in a short clip at the very end of the video , willian can be seen smashing the wing mirror off one of the audi 's with a long-range effort . team-mate remy 's hands-on-head reaction says it all ... but we 're pretty sure he wo n't have to pay to repair the damage . remy puts his hands on his head after watching willian smash the wing mirror of one of the cars . willian laughs after being allowed to drive one of the audi 's that was part of the football challenge .\", 'Poseidon (film) .

Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan\\'s new \\'Great Game\\' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital \"trampled all human values\". \"In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,\" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker \"wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors\". One employee wrote on Facebook: \"Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us.\" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it\\'s the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that\\'s the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan\\'s de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to \"avenge the blood of our people\". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul\\'s Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.', \"raheem sterling was told in no uncertain terms by liverpool supporters that they expect him to remain at the club this summer on the day he was parading the club 's new home kit at anfield .\\nthe new gingham design , presented to supporters at anfield on friday , is the first offering from us sports brand new balance , who struck a record-breaking £ 300million four-year kit deal to replace sister company warrior as liverpool 's suppliers .\\nthe message was ` hold nothing back ' as sterling , daniel sturridge , martin skrtel and simon mignolet unveiled the new home strip to fans in the centenary stand on friday afternoon .\\nraheem sterling ( 2nd r ) models liverpool 's new kit alongside ( l-r ) adam lallana , daniel sturridge , jordan henderson and philippe coutinho\\nthe liverpool stars , including goalkeeper simon mignolet in his new jersey , made their way to anfield to present the kit to the fans\\nsturridge uploaded these photographs to his instagram account as he posed with sterling , mignolet and skrtel at the launch\\nnew balance struck a record-breaking £ 300million four-year kit deal to replace sister company warrior as liverpool 's suppliers\\nit looks like ( l-r ) skrtel , mignolet , sterling and sturridge will all remain at liverpool this season after unveiling in the new strip\\nfans pack into the centenary stand on friday afternoon to catch a glimpse of the new balance strip\\nraheem sterling ( left ) and daniel sturridge ( right ) sit on stage while a q&a is conducted at anfield\\nthe players arrive at anfield as they prepare for the launch of the 2015/16 strip\\nonly a week ago , sterling held nothing back with his stunning interview after rejecting a new £ 100,000-a-week deal at liverpool .\\nhe also sensationally revealed that he was flattered to be linked with arsenal to cast a huge question mark over his future .\\nbut liverpool are adamant that the 20-year-old , who has two years left to run on his contract , will not be quitting this summer and are putting their shirt on him to stay .\\none fan shouted ` make sure we see you in that next season ' at sterling , and the heckle was greeted with applause .\\nsterling told an expectant audience : ` the fans are great .\\nit 's a massive boost when you come out of the changing room and hear them sing that song .\\nyou ca n't get better than that .\\nwhile players also turned their attention to the fa cup semi-final against aston villa at wembley next weekend .\\n` it 's special to play at wembley , especially because it 's my home town , ' sterling said .\\nand sturridge added : ` winning the fa cup would be huge for everyone - players , fans and staff .\\nwe all want to have some success and we hope it 's this season .\\nwinning the cup could be a platform for more success in the future .\\n` it 's great to play in front of these fans .\\nit 's an unbelievable feeling .\\nit 's a cliche but it 's true , they are our 12th man .\\nevery week we try to get 3 points for the fans .\\nthey mean a lot to us .

'\", \"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park. The fourth-tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday, but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian. Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross. Cheltenham's exit ended League Two's representation in the EFL Cup before Thursday's third-round draw. Match ends, Cheltenham Town 0, West Ham United 2.

Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

' we have lost 1-0 , that is my history , the last game , ' van gaal said . ' i say always in such games , always , you have to control your aggression .

drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .\\nbinge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more

'Just been watching the game, did you miss the coach? #RubberDub #7minutes,' Merson put on Twitter. Merson initially angered Townsend for writing in his Sky Sports column that 'if Andros Townsend can get in (the England team) then it opens it up to anybody.'

Andros Townsend scores England's equaliser in their 1-1 friendly draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday night . The former Arsenal man was proven wrong when Townsend hit a stunning equaliser for England against Italy and he duly admitted his mistake. 'It's not as though I was watching hoping he wouldn't score for England, I'm genuinely pleased for him and fair play to him – it was a great goal,' Merson said. 'It's just a matter of opinion, and my opinion was that he got pulled off after half an hour at Manchester United in front of Roy Hodgson, so he shouldn't have been in the squad.

"Chelsea have made an offer for FC Tokyo's 22-year-old forward Yoshinori Muto, according to club president Naoki Ogane. The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the £200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March . FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto . Muto tussles with Yuji Nakazawa of Yokohama F.Marinos during a J-League clash last month . Age: 22 . Club: FC Tokyo . Appearances: 37 . Goals: 16 . International caps (Japan): 11 . International goals: 1 . Did you know? Muto graduated from Keio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago . Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London. He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue. A £4million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club . Muto, pictured in action against Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season . The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year . He has continued his fine form during the current campaign, helping his club to third place in the division with three goals in four games. Yokohama Rubber - one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers - will become Chelsea's official shirt sponsors from the start of the 2015-16 season. The initial five-year deal is the biggest in the club's history, with the Blues now considering a two-week pre-season tour of Japan this summer.","22-year-old FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto has received a formal offer from Chelsea, according to club president Naoki Ogane.

"Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. 'Epidemic': By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight (file photo) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.","The passage discusses a study published in the journal Pediatrics that found a link between antibiotic use in the first six months of life and increased likelihood of obesity in toddlers. The study, conducted by Finnish researchers, compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-old children with antibiotic prescription records. The results showed that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years of age, and those who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. The study suggests that the overuse of antibiotics could be contributing to the obesity epidemic, as antibiotics may kill beneficial gut bacteria that help regulate weight. The study did not prove causation, but the researchers warned that the over-prescription of antibiotics could have unintended consequences.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.98496,0.92093,0.98779,1,1.0
"This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box. The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera . The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment.

""We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original, as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time,"" said Dirk Hoogstra, History's executive vice president and general manager. ""Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte's indomitable spirit."" Executive producer Mark Wolper, son of the original's producer David L. Wolper, added, ""Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage, to Alex Haley, to my father, and now the mantle rests with me.

"Police are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy, it was revealed yesterday. Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s . But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother’s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. ‘That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,’ he told the Sunday People. ‘I was staggered. The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me, holding me in the chair. Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence . ‘They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room.’ Afterwards, Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet. A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House – so he packed his bags immediately. Mr Lawler, a former Port of Liverpool police officer, said he was ‘haunted’ by the incident for years. After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace, but was twice rebuffed. Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard. A retired royal aide, who is now in his 80s, was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time. Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work ‘exhaustively and co-operatively’ with any police probe. A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment ‘as investigations continue’.","The passage describes the claims of a former royal footman, Christopher Lawler, who reported that he was sexually assaulted by palace aides on his first day working at Clarence House in 1978.

Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.'

"Rome (CNN)Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea . CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","The passage discusses the recent surge in migrant rescues in the Mediterranean Sea, with 8,480 migrants rescued from Friday to Monday.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not know the exact reason Alexis Sanchez chose the Emirates Stadium over Anfield - but he is glad the Chile forward will be lining up for his side rather than against them for Liverpool on Saturday. Sanchez had his selection of clubs once Barcelona had decided to let him leave, and following the World Cup, the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under Wenger's expert guidance, going on to make an instant impression in English football. The French coach, however, admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards. Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal . Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (right) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club . 'At the end of the day, only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us. I don't know why he did that, but we are happy that he made that decision,' said Wenger of the £32million Chile forward, who has netted 19 goals so far. 'I was (aware of Liverpool's interest), but you never know if it is really true, but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez (from Barcelona). 'In the negotiations, yes, it is a strength - and it makes sense, an exchange and some money for Liverpool.' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around. 'If you look at the qualities, efficiency, work-rate, fighting spirit - (he is at the) top,' the Arsenal boss added. 'When it (the game) becomes flat, he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters.' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash, Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, who has so far rejected a new contract offer. Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish, Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge. 'He has done very well. I think he found a solution at the right time,' the Arsenal manager said. 'They did well last season too, they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League, which is absolutely fantastic.' Wenger has moved to play down speculation linking him with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling .","The passage discusses Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's thoughts on Alexis Sanchez's decision to join Arsenal over Liverpool in the summer of 2014.

"(CNN)Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan, Iranian state media reported. Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur, the state-run news agency IRNA reported. The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari, the deputy governor of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province, who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan. Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants. A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. ""Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,"" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan. The Pakistani government condemned Monday's attack, calling it an ""act of terrorism."" ""The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident, which took place on Iran's territory, and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have,"" the government said in a statement Wednesday.

"(CNN)The classic video game ""Space Invaders"" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. ""When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,"" Nakatani said. He continued: ""They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth."" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as ""among the most respected men in sports-entertainment"" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

"Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific.

"Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January . A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved.

"Steve Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Barclays Premier League after a 2-0 defeat by Southampton left them battling to stay up. At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation . They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone . 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth . Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone.

"A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.","The passage describes an incident where a teacher, Ian Guffick, at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, allowed students to change their answers on SATs exams for 11-year-olds, invalidating the entire school's results.

"The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday. While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding.

Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself.

"Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’","The passage describes a rugby incident in which Nathan Hughes, a Wasps No. 8, was initially banned for three matches after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been 'reckless' for accidentally colliding with George North's head as he scored a try.

"(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","The passage describes a series of fiery sunsets in Washington, caused by smoke from wildfires in Siberia.

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series.

"These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms, multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant. The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner £400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period. The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests. It contains a large dining room where travellers can enjoy meals cooked in an adjoining kitchen, with a lounge and 'state room' at the back of the plane. More sleeping space is provided in the 'aeroloft' on the top deck of the vessel, with eight full beds for passengers who prefer to get some shut-eye on flights. Luxury: This is the lounge on board a custom-built Boeing 747-8, as depicted in an artist's impression by Greenpoint Technologies . Shuteye: The master bedroom of the £400million plane has a huge bed as well as an armchair and sofa for when the owner needs to relax . Business: The conference room of the plane could be perfect for meetings in the sky with its long table in the centre . Chill-out: The lounge decor looks like a luxury hotel, belying its true location inside a plane similar to those used by commercial airlines . Executive: This room, which can be used as an office or a guest bedroom, gives a hint to its true location thanks to the porthole-style windows . Kicking back: The main suite could easily be mistaken for a room in a top hotel thanks to its over-the-top decorations . Restaurant: The central portion of the plane hosts a dining room which is attached to a kitchen, allowing the owner to make use of the services of a private chef . Shiny: The jumbo jet is one of the most luxurious private planes ever built, with the price tag believed to have reached a total of £400million . Sofa: Parts of the plane are set aside for guests to relax while watching television, as the vessel can carry several dozen passengers . Plush: Another artist's impression of the main state room, which also contains a desk so the owner can switch between work and relaxation . Welcoming: Images of the lounge show a space very different to the normal aeroplane cabin, with the traditional rows of seats completely discarded in favour of a hotel-like ambience .

"(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: ""Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival."" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to ""reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred."" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","The passage describes a SpaceX mission to the International Space Station (ISS) that involved the launch of an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon using a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket.

"Roma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places. Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.'

Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points . Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in.

In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th.

"Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch.

"There would have been no mercy in the dressing room. Nothing is sacred in the team. When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said: ‘Mind that locker, Stokesey.’ It was here, of course, that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team. Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team . Stokes (left) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England . But Stokes (right) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores . Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs. I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who cannot capture the imagination. He has something about him, as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson’s face during the Ashes series. He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return. But I do believe he will need careful man-managing. Peter Moores, England’s coach, dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right. The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on. England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on. It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad. What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed. He can be feisty and fiery as long as it’s natural but his aggression has to be controlled. You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets. Stokes (second left) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team . Stokes (left) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test . England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential . Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally. There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible. This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game.

Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","200+ Yazidis, mostly women, children, and the ill or elderly, were released by ISIS in northern Iraq.

"Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport . A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk. James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time.

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs . Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write.

"(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for ""Barbara,"" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the ""warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions."" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited ""three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,"" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. ""For her to go to Mexico,"" Mate said, ""It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from."" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to ""navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,"" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower.

An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock.

"Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.","The passage discusses a Scottish scientist, Dr Adrian Quarterman, who is working on a project to use space lasers to convert sunlight into energy that can be used to power homes on Earth. The satellites, equipped with mirrors to harvest sunlight, will convert it into laser light and beam it back to Earth. The technology could potentially make solar power viable in areas with less sunlight, like Scotland, or provide instant power to disaster-stricken regions. Initial trials in Scotland have been successful, and Dr Quarterman plans to continue testing in Portugal. The lasers will not be powerful enough to cause harm, unlike those depicted in science fiction. However, the scientist acknowledges the potential concern about who controls these satellites.

"A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'","Stephen Munden, a 54-year-old convicted paedophile, has gone missing from a psychiatric unit.

"A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: ‘I stopped because I couldn’t see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.’ Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff . The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to ‘use an ATM’ before making a run for it. ‘The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi – I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,’ Mr Robinson told the inquest. ‘Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.’ Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker.

A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out.  Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were .

Phillips, who worked for Liam Gallagher's clothing label Pretty Green, had been out drinking with friends in Cardiff and caught a taxi home. Lacking sufficient funds to pay the fare, he and his friends decided to 'dodge' the fare by running from the taxi. Phillips ran towards the disused Northern Promenade and fell down a cliff in the dark. His body was discovered the next day by a dog walker. The taxi driver, Dave Sidaway, chased after Phillips but lost sight of him in the dark.

"Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video . The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer . Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved . This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.","The passage discusses the lack of compensation for thousands of holidaymakers who experienced passport delays during the summer.

"Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer ""concrete solutions"". ""We want someone who can speak for the royal family,"" he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. ""We welcome it, we are ready for it,"" he said. ""We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary."" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. ""A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people"". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. ""We had an agreement with the crown prince,"" he said. ""The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue."" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was ""hopeful"" that he would ""do more than his predecessor"", Hillary Clinton. ""US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more."" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. ""If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. ""It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. ""So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy."" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for ""peaceful demonstrations"", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. ""It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government."" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. ""These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail.""","The passage discusses a potential national dialogue between the Bahraini government and opposition groups, led by Sheikh Ali Salman of the al-Wefaq party. The dialogue is seen as a means to address opposition demands, but Sheikh Salman insists that the government must be willing to offer concrete solutions.

He also calls for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been imprisoned.

"He died at his home in Cambridge following an illness lasting several months, a statement on his website said. It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date. Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US.

"In the year to the end of March, 57 victims of homicide (murders and culpable homicides) were recorded - down five on the previous 12 months. This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago. As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved. The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51% of homicides (29 cases) in 2015-16. Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife. While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime, the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue, because each of the lives lost is one life too many. ""There is a clear role across a range of public services, in addition to the critical work of our police, to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called 'casual' violence. ""We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime, while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others."" Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said: ""Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution. ""Last year when the Scottish government were heralding 'record low' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop, the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase. ""Meanwhile, sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45-year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27%.""

"Mr Abbott told Australian media that the only way to prevent people dying at sea was to ""stop the boats"". Australia detains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat, and takes them to offshore processing camps to be eventually resettled elsewhere. On Thursday, the New York Times described the policy as ""brutal"". In an editorial, the newspaper said the ""ruthlessly effective"" policy was ""inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war"". It said it would be ""unconscionable"" for European leaders to consider adopting similar policies, as Mr Abbott has previously suggested. Australia has not responded to the editorial, but on Friday Mr Abbott said the image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who died trying to reach Greece by boat with his family, was ""very sad"". ""If you want to stop the deaths, if you want to stop the drownings you have got to stop the boats,"" he told ABC Radio. ""Thankfully, we have stopped that in Australia because we have stopped the illegal boats."" On Thursday, Mr Abbott angered Australian Jewish groups by saying the so-called Islamic State (IS), from which many of the migrants to Europe are fleeing, was worse than the Nazis. ""The Nazis did terrible evil, but they had a sufficient sense of shame to try to hide it,"" he told Sydney Radio 2GB. But IS militants, he said, ""boast about their evil, this is the extraordinary thing"". The Executive Council of Australian Jewry Robert Goot said the comment was ""injudicious and unfortunate"", saying there was ""a fundamental difference between organised acts of terrorism and a genocide systematically implemented by a state as essential policy"". ""The crimes of Islamic State are indeed horrific but cannot be compared to the systematic round-up of millions of people and their despatch to purpose-built death camps for mass murder,"" he told Australian media. Mr Abbott later said he stood by his comments, but that he was not in the ""business of ranking evil"".","The passage discusses former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's defense of Australia's policy of detaining migrants who try to reach the country by boat and taking them to offshore processing camps.

"Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"". However, the two sides would keep talking about counter-terrorism operations in Syria to avoid unnecessary clashes.","The US has suspended talks with Russia over the Syrian conflict, blaming Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying attacks on civilians, particularly in Aleppo.

"Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"". ""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. ""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already. ""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. ""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. ""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at."" But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods."" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. ""Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. ""That seems fairer to me,"" he added. The think tank also said the move would be ""extremely popular"" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be ""cleansed"" of ""hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices"". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced ""radical reforms"" to ""get Britain building"" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme ""set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes"". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure ""social housing goes to those in greatest need"", he added.","The passage discusses a report by the think tank Policy Exchange suggesting that selling high-value social homes when they become vacant could raise £4.5bn a year, which could be used to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes.

"Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months. It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a ""similar location and mechanism"", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking"", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: ""We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. ""We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. ""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. ""Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site. ""Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).

"The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday. The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

"Pro-Kremlin party A Just Russia put forward both bills, and linked them directly to the situation in Ukraine. Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.","The Pro-Kremlin party, A Just Russia, has proposed two bills in response to the crisis in Ukraine, particularly in the Crimea region where separatist and pro-Russian sentiments are strong.

"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

""We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,"" says Mr Parker. ""The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity."" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. ""Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,"" he says. ""The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. ""It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world."" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one ""Joseph Carpenter"" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. ""It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,"" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. ""The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago."" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being ""too religious"". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. ""We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,"" says founder Roald Lidal. ""One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,"" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. ""There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga."" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. ""I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,"" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. ""The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.""

"Chechen Muslim clerics met on 3 April, two days after the paper's revelations, and said the report had insulted their faith and the dignity of Chechen men. ""Retribution will catch up with the true instigators, wherever and whoever they are,"" their resolution said. Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for ""reprisals against journalists"". ""We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,"" the paper said. On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. ""All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,"" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them ""lies"". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that ""retribution"" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April. ""There will be retribution!"" he told the Russian news website RBC. ""Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics."" Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. ""We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,"" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses.

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is ""a new low"". Investing Solutions said ""the bulk"" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help ""the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress"". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing ""the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation"". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. ""It's all about the money, it's not about the people,"" he added. ""I thought inspections would be made."" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a ""dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable"". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low."" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords ""who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients"". He also said his company was ""genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property"". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have ""authority from the relevant parties"" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for ""rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing"".","The passage discusses the relationship between Investing Solutions, a letting agent, and Fresh Start Housing, a charity. Investing Solutions receives housing benefit payments by providing accommodation for single homeless men, often in shared properties, and charging housing benefit for each individual rather than the property as a whole. Fresh Start Housing refers clients to Investing Solutions, and both organizations are based in the same building, with the same founder, Samir Patel. The arrangement is profitable for Investing Solutions, as they receive a significant portion of the housing benefit payments, while the property owners receive less. Some tenants have reported issues with the properties, and there are concerns about the ethics of the arrangement. Fresh Start Housing states that they are an independent charity and that the majority of properties are sourced from private landlords. The Department for Communities and Local Government states that local authorities are responsible for ensuring the proper use of taxpayers' money.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.8719,0.81777,0.96933,1,1.0

"The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: ""I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves."" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. ""Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,"" said Bennett. ""To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine."" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: ""I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands."" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a ""litany of information"" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were ""several reasons to approve the fight"". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. ""I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,"" said Bennett. ""He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. ""Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. ""Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. ""That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight."" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: ""He's good to go."" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an ""out of control"" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.","The passage discusses the upcoming boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, specifically focusing on the potential use of lighter gloves.

"Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. ""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. ""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. ""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. ""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."" His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"". ""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. ""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,"" he says. ""The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards."" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. ""Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. ""But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. ""When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. ""Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. ""The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. ""At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. ""I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. ""He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'"" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the ""Stab in the Back"" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline. ""As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,"" says Mr Smith. ""It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.""","The Sunday Post, a newspaper based in Dundee, closed its London office on Fleet Street, which was once the hub of British journalism.

"It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""","The passage is a study conducted by the University of Edinburgh researchers, which found that children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime.

Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout."" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and ""fingerprinting"" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named ""Dynamic Mongoose"", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a ""key vulnerability"". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be ""exceptionally worried"" that it is seen as a ""soft touch"", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.","The passage describes a Nato anti-submarine warfare exercise, ""Dynamic Mongoose,"" in response to increased Russian submarine activity in the same waters. The exercise involves 10 Nato warships, including the USS Vicksburg and the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, searching for the German U-boat U33, which is acting as the enemy. The exercise highlights the challenges of locating submarines and the growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength, particularly in submarine development. Russia has a fleet of around 60 submarines, and has recently launched a new ""quiet"" submarine. The exercise also highlights Britain's lack of maritime patrol aircraft, a significant gap in the UK's defenses.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.90531,0.97207,0.9943,1,1.0
"United Nations officials rarely use the words ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing,"" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. ""They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,"" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. ""They don't want us,"" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. ""These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them."" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.""We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,"" he said. ""It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed."" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. ""This has been unrelenting since July,"" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. ""The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides."" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. ""War, war, war,"" she began, ""who are you and where do you come from?"" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. ""You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan."" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

The slowdown in China's growth has ongoing implications for various businesses and industries.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.99817,0.96689,0.99083,1,1.0
"The call was made at a scrutiny meeting of the council to discuss the problems surrounding the new vessel. Council leader Dave Stewart said the crossing at Cowes would be free until 2 July ""in recognition of the problems"" and to allow feedback. Mr Stewart said the council had ordered a review of the project by auditors. He said it had been a ""frustrating and disappointing start"" to the ferry. Since launching late on 14 May the chain ferry has broken down, run aground and been suspended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency due to ""training issues"". Cars have also been damaged getting on and off. Shopkeeper Angie Booth, who owns Valu-4-U in East Cowes, said: ""Whether I come out of this and survive I am not sure - other businesses too. We are bearing the brunt of the loss of almost six months of trade. ""Will you compensate local businesses, the same as for damaged cars?"" Transport councillor Ian Ward said compensation was up for discussion. He added: ""I don't think it's a disaster. It's a prototype. There are bound to be teething problems.

"Matching Models in London describes itself as ""an international temp agency for beautiful and talented people"". It advertised for a personal assistant with ""a classic look, brown long hair with b-c cup"". The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called it ""appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women"". Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC, said it would be writing to Matching Models ""asking for them to clarify their hiring practices immediately"". Meanwhile, women's equality campaigners said its ads were ""straight out of the 1970s"". Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: ""It is extraordinary that they are taking this approach and almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation. ""If we ever wonder why the battle for gender equality hasn't been won, this is a timely reminder."" The agency's founder Nathalie Jansen said: ""Our clients are important to us - and looks are important."" Another job advert on the agency's website asks a ""sexy female driver"" to drive a Porsche Cayenne two days a week for between £40,000 and £50,000-a-year for a Knightsbridge-based businessman and polo team owner. Employment lawyer James Lynas, partner at Winckworth Sherwood, said the advert was ""clearly unlawful"", adding anyone could complain to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who have powers to intervene. He said an employment tribunal could find the use of phrases such as ""beautiful and attractive"" were really code for ""young"", and in reality discriminatory against older women. He added: ""A male driver who genuinely wanted the job could submit an application and sue for sex discrimination if rejected. Compensation for such claims is unlimited. "" A statement on the agency's website states: ""It is almost politically incorrect to request someone to work for you that is both attractive as well as professionally equipped with the right set of skills. ""However, our company understands the importance of having the right people representing your company, because after all, first impressions count."" But Ms Hilsenrath said: ""Matching Models are right about one thing; first impressions count, but the important stuff is not about your hair colour. ""If they wish to maintain their reputation, they should act like a business in the 21st Century and consign this type of sexism to the history books."" Under the 2010 Equality Act, it is against the law to say, or imply, that you will discriminate against anyone - including saying that you are unable to cater for disabled workers. Employers are also not allowed to question a candidate's age, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children or plans to have children, disability, race or religion. As for specifying clothing sizes, an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work. Talking about the personal assistant advert, Ms Jansen said: ""The client who wants the specific cup size is an older gentleman - he has a specific outfit he designed with Christian Dior. He wants a ""Jackie O"" look. And he wants a lady with a smaller cup size to fit into the outfit."" ""I recently had an Indian businessman who interviewed 60 women from my firm. He wanted a blonde, blue eyed, Greek woman. He hired 6 of them to work on his plane."" Matching Models clients include MTV, Louis Vuitton, Coca-Cola, the Renualt Formula 1 team and Harrods. Ms Jansen said she had hired 5,000 people worldwide and pointed out MTV wanted models with tattoos and piercings.","The passage discusses a controversy surrounding Matching Models in London, an international temp agency, which has been criticized for discriminatory job advertisements.

The agency's founder, Nathalie Jansen, defends their practices, stating that looks are important to their clients. The agency's hiring practices are being investigated by the EHRC, and employment lawyers have deemed the advertisements as potentially discriminatory.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15. His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial. The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations. The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party. Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party. Police had initially said the vehicle reversed ""aggressively"" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him. He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.

"The president-elect has said Mrs Trump and Barron will move to Washington ""very soon, after he's finished with school"", but has not put an actual date on the move. But transition spokesman Jason Miller's insistence that the Trumps were ""energised and excited about their new role serving the country"" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media. ""First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world,"" wrote one Twitter user, Pamela Benbow. ""Melania Trump's decision is appalling."" Others joked it was Mrs Trump's taste in interiors which had prompted the decision, while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps' marriage. However, the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising. There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands' years as commander-in-chief: Martha Washington, because it had yet to be built, and Anna Harrison, because her husband died before she could take up residence. But Mrs Trump's decision has its supporters. ""Good, this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron's age,"" one Twitter user noted. However, it is not out of character for Mrs Trump, who has repeatedly stressed that Barron, 10, is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers. But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before? William Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season. The president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time. The first lady referred to the first home as ""Oak View"" but it was more commonly known as ""Red Top"" because of its red roof. But the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House. ""The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not,"" Mr Seale said. ""It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school. I don't find it very surprising."" Mr Seale noted that the children of President John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison's death, were not immediately moved to the White House. James Madison's wife, Dolley Madison, also sent her son from her first marriage, Payne Todd, away to school. There have been two sets of school age children living in the White House in the past three decades: Chelsea Clinton, who was 12 at the time, and Malia and Sasha Obama, who were 10 and seven respectively. They also had to move across the country when their fathers became president - but all three lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from the day of the inauguration. In fact, the Obamas avoided the problem of the girls having to change school mid-term by moving to Washington early, allowing them to start a new school a few weeks before Dad was inaugurated in January 2009. Read more: Why Obama may not go quietly Mrs Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority, with everything else coming second. Reading between the lines, it suggests she will not be taking on the full-time role predecessors like Mrs Obama have. Officially, the role of the first lady is only ceremonial - she is supposed to be the White House's hostess, organising and attending functions with or without their spouses. In more recent times, they have also sought out causes to support and promote. Mrs Obama has used her time backing a number of initiatives and projects, including Let Girls Learn, that aims to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school. The first lady occupies a very public role, according to Mr Seale. ""It gives a kind of personal side to the White House. It might even be considered vital to the public's perception of the president,"" he said. ""[The president] is an administrator and a he is a symbol and I think the first lady's role is very important to that symbol part."" Lou Henry Hoover, wife to President Herbert Hoover, was the first president's wife to really take on an active public role, Mr Seale said. Her immediate successor, Eleanor Roosevelt, also served as a more visible first lady in her husband's administration. One notable first lady who was reluctant to step into the public role was Nancy Reagan, according to Mr Seale. Mrs Reagan, who had a big influence on her husband's presidency and would later become known for her anti-drug campaign, was at first only focused on being a supportive wife. ""Her big interest in the world was her husband,"" Mr Seale said, adding that she was a very private person. As to what Melania's priorities will be there is only one hint - she is interested in tackling cyber-bullying. Read more: Taking to the streets for women's issues It has happened in the past. However, not when the president's wife has still been alive. Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph took the role in 1801, while Angelica van Buren took up the duties of a first lady after marrying President Martin van Buren's son in 1838. Both men had lost their wives almost 20 years earlier. However, could Ivanka Trump - described as her father's ""proxy wife"" by Vanity Fair during the election campaign - take up some of the responsibility from her step-mother? There is more recent precedent, too. Chelsea performed some of her mother's duties during the final days of her father's presidency, while Mrs Clinton concentrated on her own political career. The White House can be whatever the family makes it. Chelsea was known to do her homework in the Oval Office from time to time, while she also hosted sleepovers for friends - which could mean they found themselves sitting with the President the next morning, as Bill Clinton always tried to have breakfast with his daughter. Both Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama fit their duties as First Lady around their children, and both families asked for the press to respect their daughters' privacy - requests which were, on the whole, respected. The Obamas are also strict about putting time aside for the girls: family dinner takes place every night at 18:30. Mr Obama has said only a national emergency will stop him joining his family. ""The surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more 'normal' than it's ever been,"" the President said in an interview with US magazine More earlier this year. It is a response echoed by Chelsea about her own years. She told the Huffington Post: ""I was always deeply aware that I was living in history. But then I would have dinner with my parents at the kitchen table every night. There was so much about my life that also was normal.""","The passage discusses the decision of Melania Trump, the wife of the president-elect, to not move to the White House immediately after the inauguration, but to wait until the end of her son Barron's school year.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"".

Chinese Grand Prix race results Chinese Grand Prix coverage details","The 2016 Chinese Grand Prix was marked by a series of incidents, including a first-lap collision involving Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, and Kimi Raikkonen. Hamilton, who started from the back, suffered a broken front wing and had to make five pit stops. Despite the collision, Vettel managed to finish second, while Raikkonen recovered to fifth place. The incident between Vettel and Raikkonen was caused by Daniil Kvyat, who was confronted by Vettel after the race. Hamilton's progress was hindered by damage to his car, and he was unable to recover as much ground as the Ferraris. Nico Rosberg won the race, extending his lead in the championship over Hamilton to 36 points.

"In an interview with newspaper Die Zeit, Hitzlsperger said he was coming out to advance discussion of a topic that was ""simply ignored"" in German football. He is the most prominent footballer to publicly reveal his homosexuality and his former team-mates were quick to praise his announcement. Arsenal and Germany forward Lukas Podolski wrote on Twitter: ""Respect to Thomas Hitzlsperger! That was a courageous and correct decision and an important step."" And retired defender Arne Friedrich, who played with Hitzlsperger at Euro 2008, wrote: ""Proud of you Thomas. A good decision and in my opinion the right time."" There was also support for Hitzlsperger from leading figures in German football administration. ""Finally, a footballer has the courage to make his sexuality public,"" said Theo Zwanziger, the former president of the German Football Association. Bundesliga president Reinhard Rauball said in a statement: ""The decision of Thomas Hitzlsperger to be the first prominent footballer to make public his homosexuality is - even after his active career - a huge and courageous step, and surely leads the way in the fight against homophobia."" Gary Lineker ‏@GaryLineker Congratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger on bravely being the first player to have played in the PL to 'come out' Joseph Barton ‏@Joey7Barton 15m Thomas Hitzlsperger has shown a lot of courage today.

John Amaechi OBE ‏@JohnAmaechi Congratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger - welcome to the club! Bayern Munich, the club where Hitzlsperger began his career as a junior, also tweeted their support for the midfielder's ""brave step"". Hitzlsperger's announcement is seen as a watershed moment in Germany, which like England has struggled with the problem of homophobia in football. Zwanziger admitted that football was ""now as ever a hard business, where unfortunately an open discourse about homosexuality is still not taken for granted"". Current Germany captain Philipp Lahm created controversy in 2011 when he wrote in his autobiography that he would encourage gay footballers to keep quiet about their sexuality. ""I would not encourage any gay professional footballer to come out,"" he wrote at the time. ""I would fear that he would end up like Justin Fashanu [the English footballer who killed himself after revealing that he was gay]."" The last German footballer to come out was second tier player Marcus Urban, who told Die Welt in 2007 that he knew of at least three gay footballers in the Bundesliga who were too scared to reveal their sexuality. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert praised Hitzlsperger for going public. ""It's good that he's spoken about something which is important to him,"" Seibert told a media briefing. ""We live in a country where nobody should be worried about making his sexuality known or concerned about intolerance. ""We judge footballers on whether they have behaved well and worthily on and off the pitch and I believe that both are the case with Mr Hitzlsperger."" Openly Gay German politician Volker Beck said he hoped Hitzlsperger's announcement would encourage others to do the same. ""I hope that Hitzlsperger's courageous step contributes to finally breaking down this taboo,"" he said. ""It's now the job of the German FA to embolden active players [to do the same]."" And Zwanziger said he was optimistic that Hitzlsperger's announcement would lead to greater openness about sexuality in German football. He said: ""I'm confident that sexual orientations will soon not be an issue in football at all.""","Thomas Hitzlsperger, a former German footballer, has publicly revealed his homosexuality, becoming the most prominent footballer to do so.

"Mr Schmidt told the BBC that the company did what was ""legally required"" to pay the right amount of taxes. Google paid Â£10m in UK corporate taxes between 2006 and 2011. Mr Schmidt said it was up to the government to change its tax system if it wanted companies to pay more taxes. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week, he said: ""What we are doing is legal. I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional. ""I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate. You pay the taxes. ""If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less. That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom."" Meanwhile, the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms. She told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret, meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules. Google, most of whose UK sales are routed through Ireland, is one of the multinationals strongly criticised for organising their tax affairs in ways that minimise the amounts they pay in the UK. Last week, European Union leaders agreed to tackle tax avoidance through an ""automatic information exchange between tax authorities"" to monitor the situation. The Google chairman has previously argued that corporate taxes should be levied in the country where it conducts economic activity and takes risks, rather than where products are consumed. He has also called for a debate on international tax reform. ""Politicians - not companies - [should] set the rules...When legislators are doing the lobbying and companies are articulating the law as it stands, it's a confusing spectacle for everyone,"" he recently wrote in the Observer. ""Our hope is to move the debate forward, with everyone engaged constructively in developing a clearer, simpler system - one in which companies that abide by the law know that the politicians who devised the rules are willing to defend and commend them.""","The passage discusses Google's tax payments in the UK, with CEO Mr Schmidt stating that the company pays the legally required amount of taxes.

"The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: ""The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.""","The NHS regulator, NHS Improvement, is seeking to reduce the agency staff spending by £1bn, from the current £3.6bn, by the end of this financial year.

""The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) haven't brought one potential client to Longford in over four years,"" he says.

""You have the Shannon, just three miles from here you have the River Inny, you have the Royal Canal, you have huge infrastructure here and we're always open for new tourists to come in to this area."" The Center Parcs announcement will not harm the government's chances in next year's expected general election, but traders like Matt O'Brien believe more could be done to boost local business. ""At the moment a lot of people are unhappy at paying for parking on the street,"" he says. ""Some of our neighbouring towns don't have parking charges.

EnQuest said ""additional precautionary steps"" had since been taken. Wood Group said it was committed to employee safety. Mr Innes - who said he has struggled to find more work since raising concerns - said the workers now faced cancer fears, and blood tests were ongoing. He said EnQuest had failed in its duty of care. The men were working at Thistle, 125 miles (201 km) north east of Shetland, doing shutdown work with pipe equipment. Mr Innes claimed they were told there was a problem two thirds of the way through the trip. He claimed a health and safety manager told them a reading had been taken the night before and all the work was stopped. He said: ""We had all been working on it without the proper PPE (personal protective equipment), because they had assumed it was clear. ""At first we were all in shock. ""We have been exposed to radioactive material for hours at a time."" He said they had been told the levels of radiation may not cause them long-term harm, but he was continuing to undergo tests.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region.

As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.

"Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said a  new charter arrangement would end the long-running row over seafarers' pay. The RMT union had claimed some workers on board two freight boats were paid less than Â£4 an hour. The charter change will see contracted out services return to operator Serco Northlink from next month. The freight vessels Hellier and Hildasay have been operated by Seatruck, which is contracted to run the service by Serco Northlink. Seatruck argued the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew, many of whom are non-UK residents. Serco Northlink said it had repeatedly offered to bridge the pay gap and backdate it, but Seatruck declined to accept. Mr Yousaf said the new arrangements would come into force early next month subject to some financial and regulatory details being finalised. He said: ""I'm very pleased to see an agreement in principle now in place to end this long running issue around the freight vessels serving the Northern Isles. ""The new charter basis will allow the wage issue to be resolved. Going forward, I can confirm that all crew members will be paid at least the minimum wage.""

Jamie Mitchell, 35, of Apple Close, had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr Dickie and his mother. He shouted ""yes"" and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester Crown Court. The trial heard Mrs Mitchell and Mr Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a ""down phase"" when Mr Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May. In the evening, Mr Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr Dickie to the holiday park bar and got ""tanked up"" on alcohol. The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public. Mr Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight.

"Temperton died in London last week at the age of 66 after ""a brief aggressive battle with cancer"", Jon Platt of Warner/Chappell music publishing said. Temperton's other hits included Off The Wall and Baby Be Mine for Jackson and Boogie Nights for his band Heatwave. Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers was among those paying tribute, tweeting: ""Your genius gave us a funkier world!"" Michael Jackson's sister LaToya wrote: ""A brilliant prolific #songwriter Rod Temperton may you #RIP one of my favorite #songs Rock With You #Thriller #legend #Music #MichaelJackson"" Producer and DJ Mark Ronson wrote: ""So devastated to hear that Rod Temperton has passed away. a wonderful man & one of my favourite songwriters ever. thank you for the magic x"" Temperton, whose private funeral has taken place, was nicknamed The Invisible Man because of his low profile. Born in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, Temperton traced his songwriting ability back to his father's influence. ""My father wasn't the kind of person who would read you a story before you went off to sleep,"" he once said. ""He used to put a transistor radio in the crib and I would go to sleep listening to Radio Luxembourg, and I think somehow that had an influence."" In the 1970s, after a spell working in a frozen food factory in Grimsby, he answered an advert in Melody Maker magazine for a keyboardist. The band he joined was disco group Heatwave, and his songs like Boogie Nights, Always & Forever and Groove Line became big hits for the band in the 1970s. By the time he left the band in 1978, his tunes had caught the attention of producer Quincy Jones, who was looking for songwriters for a new Michael Jackson LP. Temperton penned three songs for Off The Wall, which became Jackson's breakthrough solo album - the title track, Rock With You and Burn This Disco Out. He went on to write three more for follow-up Thriller - the title track, which became one of Jackson's signature smashes, plus Baby Be Mine and The Lady in My Life. They helped make Thriller the best-selling album of all time in the US, with 32 million copies sold. His tunes have also been recorded by artists including Anita Baker, Donna Summer, Aretha Franklin and The Brothers Johnson. Temperton won a Grammy Award in 1990 for his work on Birdland, from Quincy Jones's album Back on the Block. He was nominated for two Oscars in 1986 for his work with Jones on the soundtrack for The Color Purple. He once summed up his approach to songwriting: ""The first criteria is write something you love first, and once you feel those hairs standing up on the back of your hand, you can go to the world."" In a statement released on Wednesday, Warner/Chappell's Jon Platt said: ""His family is devastated and request total privacy at this, the saddest of sad times."" Vocalist Chaka Khan, who recorded Temperton's tracks with the funk band Rufus, paid tribute, writing on Twitter: ""Thank u 4 your superlative songwriting @RodTemperton. U will always Live in Me.

"Swansea University's Dr Neil Loader and Emeritus Prof Alayne Street-Perrott, are among a team who have found ancient earthworks, possibly 2,000 years old. The discoveries were made in Acre state in the western Brazilian Amazon. Researchers from the universities of Exeter and Reading, and Brazil's SÃ£o Paulo, BelÃ©m are also part of the team. Their research investigated ditched enclosures which were concealed for centuries by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation allowed the discovery of more than 450 large geometrical ""geoglyphs"". The team said the function of these mysterious sites is still little understood. They are unlikely to be villages, since archaeologists have recovered very few artefacts during excavation, and their layout does not suggest they were built for defensive reasons. Instead it is thought they were used only sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America, or Britain's own Stonehenge. Although Dr Loader - who has analysed soil samples from the geoglyphs - said the surroundings in which they were built were very different to other ritual sites around the world. He looked at phytoliths - a type of microscopic plant fossil made of silica - to reconstruct ancient vegetation; charcoal quantities, to assess the amount of ancient forest burning; and carbon stable isotopes, to indicate the type of vegetation growing there in the past. ""The indications are that the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation. So, unlike the towering Maya pyramids of Central America, they were likely not visible above the forest canopy, and this raises questions about their purpose,"" he explained. It had been assumed prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th Century, the Amazonian forests had been pristine ecosystems, free from human influence. But the new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years, which could only have been artificially brought together by humans. It suggested instead of burning large tracts of forest - either for geoglyph construction or agricultural practices - people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms. The team have likened it to a form of ""prehistoric supermarket"" of useful forest products. They said there is ""tantalizing evidence"" to suggest the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient ""agroforestry"" practices to this day.","The passage describes a discovery made by a team of researchers, including Dr Neil Loader and Emeritus Prof Alayne Street-Perrott from Swansea University, in the western Brazilian Amazon.

His mother Allison broke the news of his death on his Facebook page, saying: ""Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven."" She added: ""God bless. Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx."" The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media. Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd. The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond. The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell. On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell. Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson. The teenager wrote on his page: ""I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again. ""I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving. ""Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile."" At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity. The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months. He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked. Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school. On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment. At the time, Jak wrote: ""This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have. ""I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it. ""I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me."" In the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research. After becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike.

"After a drab game with few chances for either side, Mohamed Salah teed up El Said, who struck firmly past Uganda keeper Denis Onyango on 89 minutes. Uganda's Joseph Ochaya earlier had a goal correctly disallowed for offside. The win means Egypt play Ghana on Wednesday with top spot of Group D still at stake, while Uganda are out of their first tournament since 1978. Ghana secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 victory over Mali earlier on Saturday. On a deteriorating pitch in Port-Gentil, seven-times champions Egypt failed to break down a resolute Cranes defence for long periods. Onyango made an impressive clearing header to deny the onrushing Salah at the end of an otherwise lifeless first half. Uganda began the second half brightly, forcing veteran Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary to punch several set-pieces clear but ultimately failed to register a shot on target as Ochaya turned in Faruku Miya's through ball from a clearly offside position on 52 minutes. El Said blasted a shot well over when unmarked and Marwan Mohsen went close for the Pharaohs with a header, but Egypt appeared to be heading for their second consecutive goalless draw. However, an otherwise quiet Salah showed great composure late on to check his shot and play in El Said with a reverse pass, the substitute's close-range shot evading Onyango.

"Women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise - but are less likely to get one, the research found. The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers. It found ""no support"" for the ""reticent female"" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money. For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females. When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found. The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications. The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings. ""The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this."" He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women ""were more straightforward and tell their friends"". ""Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,"" Prof Oswald added. ""It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely."" The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change. Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: ""The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.""","The passage discusses a study on pay rise requests and outcomes for male and female workers.

"The 10-year-old Irish-bred horse collapsed after narrowly beating Thistlecrack to win the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. He was treated by veterinary staff before being pronounced dead. The British Horseracing Authority confirmed the horse suffered from a ""severe pulmonary haemorrhage"". Tony Welsh, acting chief veterinary officer for the BHA, said: ""Episodes such as this are rare, and can occur in horses which have no underlying health issues, and amongst all disciplines of sport horses. ""In spite of the rarity of these incidents, as a sport we are determined to do more to understand what causes these symptoms, and whether more can be done to prevent it."" In Saturday's race, King George winner Thistlecrack caught Many Clouds close to the finish but the Trevor Hemmings-owned gelding, ridden by Leighton Aspell, fought back to win. Many Clouds had shown symptoms of post-race ataxia in the past, which had seen him over-heat and ""wobble"" on his feet, but the horse had never collapsed before, and had shown no symptoms of post-race ataxia on Saturday.

BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght The crucial words here are ""no significant underlying health issues"". On more than one occasion, notably after his Grand National success, Many Clouds received treatment for a tendency to 'overheat', but he soon recovered, and his welfare was closely monitored by the authorities as a result. With that fact in mind, questions have been raised as to whether that condition was linked to his death, but this report concludes he was the victim of a haemorrhage rarely seen on the racetrack.","The 10-year-old horse, Many Clouds, collapsed and died after winning the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day.

"The incident began on Tuesday morning when border agents encountered two men carrying backpacks five miles (8km) east of Sumas, Washington, in the US. Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA, or ecstasy, from Canada to San Francisco. Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs. On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said. One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday. The officers took the other man, identified as Jeffrey Laviolette, into custody immediately. Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter, putting up road blocks. Nathan Hall, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Abbotsford Police Department in British Columbia early on Wednesday morning. According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr Hall and Mr Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb (26kg) of ecstasy. Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William Nickerson but a picture of Nathan Hall, the complaint alleges. Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (Â£7,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco. Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint. The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges. The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are ""a large part of our practice"".","The incident involved a failed attempt to smuggle 58lb of MDMA from Canada to San Francisco, resulting in the arrest of four individuals.

"The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had ""ironclad information"" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and ""pushed hard"" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was ""just not true"", but he hoped the resolution would ""serve as a wake-up call"" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements ""has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace"". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. ""It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,"" he said. ""We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict."" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as ""misleading critiques"" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution ""paves the way"" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. ""We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,"" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.","The UN Security Council passed a resolution, supported by the US, calling for an end to Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which are considered illegal under international law.

"He was speaking in a BBC interview in which he paid tribute to the Queen on the eve of her 90th birthday. She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday.

The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"".

The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton.

The fourth-tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday, but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian.

In one video he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side - but ""thanks to Allah's will"" was soon back on the front line. In another - masked again - he is showing off his amateur weight-lifting skills as his brothers-in-arms cheer him on. Khawaja was a member of Rayat al Tawheed - which means Flag of Unity. The group of fighters affiliated to Islamic State includes many British men, and they have spent more than a year selling a message to their supporters and would-be recruits back home. Khawaja was involved in appeals for donations, video diaries of their lives  and ""through the keyhole"" tours of fighters' quarters. Shiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR), at Kings College London, has been tracking foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. He says: ""The group that Khawaja was with in Syria was really quite dynamic,"" he says. ""They clearly had people with programming skills - they were able to put together very slick, well produced propaganda videos and posters that appealed to young British Muslims. ""They were able to play on the same cultural anchors and mores that those people recognised and know. They could speak to them as peers. ""Rayat al Tawheed helped a great deal in the early stages of this conflict with portraying the idea of volunteering as a jihadist as quite a glamorous adventurous thing - and a noble thing."" But Rayat's war was neither noble nor glamorous. Some of its material online showed gruesome scenes of death. One image showed a man's bloodied-hands with the caption ""my first time"". And another shocking image included Imran Khawaja. In this gruesome picture, the Londoner - masked yet again - is holding a bag that contains a head. The only thing we know about the victim is that he was supposedly a Syrian army soldier. But we do know that the British security service MI5 was watching - and waiting. And last June, its opportunity came. Imran Khawaja decided to come home. It's not clear why because he hasn't told the police. His cousin Tahir Bhatti, a taxi driver from Watford, agreed to help him return because the family wanted him back safely. Khawaja's own intentions are unclear. He had originally asked his cousin for money for a new gun - something Bhatti did not help him with. And then the fighter began trying to cover his tracks. As Bhatti, who has admitted assisting an offender, drove to Bulgaria to pick him up, Khawaja faked his own death with an online obituary that said he had died in battle. The announcement asked that Allah grant him the highest position in heaven. He then tried to slip back into Britain unnoticed. As the pair arrived at Dover, the police were waiting - and they ended up facing prosecution at the Old Bailey. Cdr Richard Walton, the head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command, says: ""Imran Khawaja is not a vulnerable teenager who has been enticed to travel to Syria. ""This is a man who chosen the path of terrorism, who has chosen to go out to Syria to be trained and engage in a terrorist training camp. ""We don't know why he came back, we don't know what he was planning - but we know he concealed his entry and faked his own death. This is a dangerous man."" Imran Khawaja was considered so dangerous that while he was on remand, he was held in the special unit for high risk terrorism suspects at London's maximum security Belmarsh prison. He has admitted four offences: Tahir Bhatti has pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. Khawaja had originally faced an additional charge of soliciting to murder. That allegation, the most serious to be made yet against a Syrian fighter, will lie on file.","Imran Khawaja, a 27-year-old from Southall, west London, is a British jihadist who traveled to Syria in January 2014. He was a member of Rayat al Tawheed, a group affiliated with Islamic State, and was involved in their propaganda efforts, including videos, appeals for donations, and tours of fighters' quarters. Khawaja returned to the UK in June 2014, attempting to sneak back in undetected. He faked his own death online and was arrested upon his arrival at Dover. Khawaja has admitted to four offenses, including engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism and attending a place used for terrorist training. His cousin, Tahir Bhatti, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender.

"Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to ""concede everything"", and the opposition's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith, responded that his party was giving people ""false hope"". The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal. But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. ""It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,"" the source said. For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of ""waving through the government's plans"" and ""lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit"". It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing. Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: ""The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on.""

"Yet in this election, it is way down the list of priorities for most political parties. Philip Hammond, himself a former defence secretary, has been reported as saying recently that ""there are no votes in defence"". He does not recognise the quote, but the sentiment is largely borne out by the opinion polls which show defence just scrapes into the top 10 of electorate concerns, way behind the economy, the NHS and immigration. UK military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya may have also contributed to a sense of combat fatigue among the public and a reticence by politicians to focus on the subject. James de Waal, a senior fellow at independent think tank Chatham House, says in this campaign, politicians have been ""on the defensive on defence"". This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK’s defence forces at home and abroad. Policy guide: Where the parties stand To find out Labour and Conservative policies on the subject you will have to persevere to page 77 of both their manifestos. Even then they are pretty short on detail and do not really address the difficult decisions the next government is likely to face. So to help, here is a guide to some of the more sensitive issues being left out. Most analysts, and politicians, agree the world is becoming more dangerous and unstable, whether that is shown by thousands of migrants fleeing so-called failed states, the threat from Islamic extremism, or a more belligerent Russia. Yet at the same time, most European nations, including the UK, have been making significant cuts to their armed forces. The size of the UK's regular Army is being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000. You could fit that number in Wembley Stadium and still have seats to spare. The Royal Navy now has a fleet of just 19 warships, while the RAF has been left with eight - soon to be seven - front-line fast jet squadrons. There are some things the UK military can no longer do - so-called capability gaps. The UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft. It has to rely on its Nato allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters. At the start of the last parliament, David Cameron could boast that the UK was the fourth biggest spender on defence in the world. Now, according to the Stockholm International Research Institute, the UK has fallen to sixth place, behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and France. A commitment to spend 2% of the nation's wealth, or GDP, on defence is conspicuous by its absence. Only two smaller parties - UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party - say they would continue to meet that goal. But all the indications suggest the UK will soon fall below the Nato threshold. Malcolm Chalmers, of the defence think tank Royal United Services Institute, says on current projections, UK defence spending will fall to 1.7% by the end of the decade. If there are more cuts it could fall to 1.5%. He calculates that defence would require another £25bn over the next five years to stay above 2%. The military top brass know that is not going to happen. Their planning assumptions are based on flat spending plus an annual increase of 1% in the equipment budget. Spending 2% is not mandatory to Nato membership. Few states do, but it is totemic. The US will inevitably think less of a key ally that no longer lives up to that commitment, especially when David Cameron recently lectured others on the need to increase defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales. In US eyes, the UK's credibility will inevitably suffer if, as seems likely, it fails to meet the 2% target. It is more than likely that any future government will have to make more cuts in defence. The question is by how much? Over the lifetime of the last parliament, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) cut its budget by about 8%. With the Conservatives, Labour, and the Lib Dems promising to bring down the budget deficit, there will have to be more savings in public spending. None of these three parties say they would ring-fence or protect defence, like the NHS or overseas aid. The MoD has reason to be nervous - it has the second largest non-protected budget, after welfare, of £34bn a year. Another Conservative-led government plans to make savings of around £12bn a year. Shared across the board that could mean the MoD losing at least another  £2bn-£3bn of its annual budget. But Michael Clark, director of defence think tank Rusi, says most of the political parties appear to be backing away from further big cuts, in part because UKIP has made defence an issue during the campaign. The Conservatives also appear to have limited their options. They are promising to replace Trident, to increase the defence equipment budget by 1% a year, and to make no further cuts to the size of the regular army. Mr Clark says those commitments will make it hard to find ""significant savings"" in defence. But without raiding the MoD's coffers, he says, the Conservatives' entire fiscal plans would ""go out of the window"". Labour has been careful to avoid making similar commitments. Military chiefs, though, are still worried. Gen Sir Richard Shirreff, who was the second most senior military commander at Nato, says: "" I fear it's almost certain that there will be more cuts."" The Conservatives and UKIP are committed to renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent with a like-for-like replacement. That means building four new submarines at an estimated cost of at least £20bn. According to the MoD's own figures, about one quarter of committed defence equipment spending over the next decade will be on the successor submarines and deterrent systems. So it is an obvious area to look for savings. Labour say they would continue the round-the-clock patrols, known as Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), but will look at whether that can be done with three rather than four submarines. The Liberal Democrats say they would retain a nuclear deterrent, but end CASD - what has been dubbed a ""part-time deterrent"". The SNP and the Greens would scrap it altogether. There is no political consensus. James de Waal, who worked in the MoD on the last Strategic Defence Review says: ""Trident might be up for grabs."" It is worth remembering the Tories went into the last election committed to renewing Trident, but as part of the coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats, postponed the decision. What is to prevent another review and another delay, especially if a party like the SNP holds the balance of power? Paul Ingram, who heads the British American Security Information Council, says the nuclear programme will have to be included in the next Strategic Defence Review, due after the election. Not least because he says the US will find it hard to stomach a key ally spending all that money on the nuclear programme, if it means contemplating further cuts to the UK's conventional forces. By the end of this decade, after a gap of 10 years, the UK will have two new operational aircraft carriers. The Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. They should be a symbol of power and of global ambition. But there is a danger that they will be more like the emperor's new clothes. On current manning levels, the Royal Navy will struggle to crew both carriers, even if as planned only one of them is operational at any given time. Plans to equip them with the new F-35 jet, have already had to be scaled down. There is space on board for 36 F-35s, but current plans are to sail with just 12. The current chief of the defence staff, Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton, has already warned of the dangers of a ""hollow force"" with ""exquisite equipment"" but not enough people. Politicians have long boasted that in military terms Britain can punch above its weight on the world stage. But it's becoming harder to live up to that rhetoric.","The passage discusses the topic of defense and its lack of prominence in the political parties' priorities for the upcoming election. The public's concern for defense is low, and the military has faced budget cuts, reducing the size of the regular Army and the number of warships and fast jet squadrons. The UK has fallen to sixth place in defense spending, and there is a lack of commitment to spend 2% of the nation's wealth on defense. The passage also mentions the potential for further cuts in defense spending, the debate over the renewal of Britain's nuclear deterrent, and the challenges of manning and equipping the new aircraft carriers.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.7214,0.96504,0.99367,1,1.0
"However the Spanish champions insisted they had not committed any offence.

"Muir, 23, broke McColgan's 25-year-old record by 14 seconds at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow on Wednesday, with a time of 14 minutes, 49.12 seconds. McColgan said she felt excited to see her last record broken by Muir. She had earlier raised concerns about whether Muir's race had met all the criteria set by UK Athletics for record-breaking attempts. She had told BBC radio's John Beattie programme it needed to be a ""genuine race"" and may not have been as ""Muir had been the only competitor"". ""It was a mixed 3K race where all the other girls ran 3K and it was only Laura who finished the 5K,"" she said. ""We were wondering if to get a record ratified you have to have drug testing as well. ""So we were just wondering if they had everything in place to actually have it ratified as a record."" However, British Athletics confirmed Muir's time was expected to be classified as official. A spokesman said: ""The time will undergo ratification but is expected to be confirmed"". Rules stipulate that if there is no doping control at an event where a British record is set, there is no requirement for the athlete to submit drug tests. McColgan said Muir had what it took to win world medals. ""To run 14.49 indoors is pretty good,"" she said. ""But she is a 3.55 minute 1,500m runner, so you would expect someone like Laura to run (5K) in something like 14.30. ""So there's still a lot more in the tank and I don't think that's the fastest 5K she's ever going to run. ""She's got the ability to get down to 14.30, which is really mixing it with the top in the world."" McColgan said Muir's race, which saw her lap other runners, had been similar to her own record-breaking race 25 years ago. ""I ran on my own right from the start with nobody really pushing me at all,"" she said. ""I actually lapped a young Paula Radcliffe about two or three times."" McColgan said it was a bonus that her record was beaten by a fellow Scot. ""She is world class,"" she said. ""She just needs to get her race tactics right so that she can start winning some medals.""

Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. ""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday.

"Met Police barrister Richard Horwell QC said suspects Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi had no personal motive to kill. The Russian state ""is likely to have been the sponsor of this plot"" and had ""reasons aplenty"" for wishing him ""not only harm, but death"", he said. UK officials believe the two suspects poisoned Mr Litvinenko, 43, in London in 2006 but they deny any wrongdoing. Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive substance polonium-210 during a meeting with Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi. He died in hospital nearly three weeks later. The fact that polonium caused his death indicates there was some form of Russian state participation, Mr Horwell said in his closing remarks. He said: ""The evidence suggests the only credible explanation is that in one form or another the Russian state was involved in Mr Litvinenko's murder."" However, he stressed this did not mean Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved or gave the order and that there were many possible motives for the murder. Defecting to the UK in 2000, after accusing KGB successor the FSB of murdering political opponents and of corruption, could have been seen as ""akin to treachery"", he said. He also spoke of Mr Litvinenko's ""many personal attacks on Putin"". Mr Horwell has said the risk to the general public in London from polonium radiation will never be known, and also that Mr Litvinenko had been poisoned twice in the run-up to his death. He said: ""The two attacks on Mr Litvinenko were an outrage. They led to great suffering on his part and eventually to his demise. ""We will never know how dangerous the exposure of polonium to the public at large will be and what long-term effects will be visited upon Londoners."" Mr Horwell said the suspects left a ""trail of polonium"" behind and they had ""no credible answer"" to the scientific evidence against them. While the force wanted them tried for murder, this was now unlikely to happen, the inquiry heard. Attempts to extradite the two men have failed and they remain in Russia.

Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30.

"The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.","The All Progressives Congress (APC) has won 19 of the 28 governor posts in the recent elections, marking the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since the end of military rule in 1999.

"The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty, a US-based environmental lobby group. Mighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, of turning a blind eye to these practices. Both companies reject the allegations. Singapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash-and-burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia. Indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra, South Sumatra, and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. Singapore-based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99% of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry, it says it accounts for less than 1% of the global market. Mighty's report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires. It also says Olam created a ""secretive market for rogue palm oil companies"" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources. But Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a ""very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning, so it's a 'no burn-no peat-no deforestation' compliance policy"". The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday, having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so. Mr Verghese said he believed the firm's current suppliers all met Olam's strict requirements, but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete. He added that producers who do not comply with the company's sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain. Since Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam, Mighty's allegations could link Singapore's state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven. Temasek's investment in Olam means that ""the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze,"" the report says. Temasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they ""fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same."" The fund told the BBC: ""Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address. ""As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam."" It would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record. It is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations. Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible. Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas. The report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam ""bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations,"" bringing the same practices to Africa ""that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia"". In response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent. ""We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done,"" it said. ""Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain.""","The passage discusses allegations made by a US-based environmental lobby group, Mighty, against the agricultural commodities trader, Olam, and its stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek.

"Pakistan's telecoms regulator said the ban was no longer necessary because Google, which owns YouTube, had now launched a Pakistan-specific version. YouTube has denied claims that the authorities can filter content. Many young Pakistanis have welcomed the lifting of the ban but some activists want details of the deal with Google. They say there should be greater transparency of the terms agreed between Google and the government.

Pakistan's ministry of information technology said: ""Google has provided an online web process through which requests for blocking access of offending material can be made by the PTA to Google directly. ""Google/YouTube will accordingly restrict access to the said offending material for users within Pakistan."" However, a YouTube spokeswoman said government requests for the removal of content would not automatically be granted.

"Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.","The head of Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, Domenico Scala, is being asked to withdraw from the committee due to sharing nationality with one of the five presidential candidates, Gianni Infantino. This is based on a rule that states any member of the committee who has a conflict of interest must withdraw. Scala and another member, Claudio Sulser, had previously withdrawn from the committee for the same reason ahead of the 2015 elections. However, a spokesman for Scala argues that there is no conflict of interest in this case as there is no incumbent president and five candidates from different nationalities. The Liberian Football Association (LFA) chief Musa Bility has threatened to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. Bility had previously been denied participation in the elections himself and has pledged his vote to Prince Ali.

"Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year's Nations Cup. Morocco, meanwhile, were only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned a ban on its participation. We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco ""We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco,"" said Moroccan FA chief Fouzi Lekjaa. ""We are back after a little break of a few months, but it has not had a big impact. The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass."" Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began. The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead. Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000). Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare. The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over. ""I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,"" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport. Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty. The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared. The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup. Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption. ""We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,"" said Snoussi. ""But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium."" ""But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. ""We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected. ""In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match."" Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement. ""Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,"" said Snoussi. ""We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out."" Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F. Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.","The passage discusses the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations and the controversies surrounding Tunisia and Morocco's participation.

This initiative comes after doctors visited Denmark to observe their diagnostic systems, which have improved cancer survival rates. The concern is that patients in Wales without clear symptoms are waiting too long for a diagnosis, as they do not easily fit into specific treatment pathways. This results in general practitioners referring patients back and forth for multiple tests, which can take several weeks. The fear is that too many patients start treatment when their cancer has already progressed or is incurable.

The new scheme will allow 40 general practitioners in the Cynon Valley to refer patients they suspect may have cancer to a diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant within seven days. It is estimated that six patients per week will be seen and undergo various tests, ideally on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with symptoms that cause concern receive a diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area. Doctors aim to reach the majority of patients without such obvious symptoms earlier. A similar clinic will be established at Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another trial by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. These trials have been developed over the past 12 months since specialists from Wales returned from Aarhus. Denmark established diagnostic centers due to concerns that the country was lagging behind in cancer survival rates. Dr. Gareth Davies, Director of the Wales Cancer Network, believes the scheme will reassure patients and speed up the diagnostic process.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game.

"Ofsted says it has found evidence of children being taught in squalid conditions in three places in Birmingham which have now closed. Anyone running illegal schools could face a jail term of up to 51 weeks. Ministers are also consulting on plans for more regulation of places teaching for more than 6 to 8 hours a week. Sir Michael Wilshaw, Chief Inspector of Schools in England, told the BBC this week that his inspectors were visibly shocked by the conditions they found. It is understood that a total of 18 unregulated schools, mainly in Muslim communities in the Midlands, have been visited as part of an investigation in recent months. Three places in Birmingham have been closed and the owners are being investigated under suspicion of running an illegal school. Sir Michael said the cases uncovered were likely to be the ""tip of the iceberg"" and he was seriously concerned that children were at risk of being abused or radicalised. Any place where children are taught for more than 20 hours a week has to register as a school. Some places describing themselves as part-time education centres or ""flexi schools""  are operating within the law providing support for home-educated children. But Ofsted and ministers are concerned that some are taking advantage of the legal right to home educate to operate what are in fact illegal schools. In a letter to the education secretary on Friday, Sir Michael suggested officials had been slow to take decisive action in the three places which Ofsted had closed with the help of the local council. ""This was achieved in spite of your officials providing, what I believe to be, confusing and unhelpful advice to the proprietors that they could now apply to register their provision."" The government has provided funding for a team of six inspectors whose job will be to investigate illegal schools. While most of the places visited by Ofsted so far have been in Muslim communities, inspectors may also turn their attention to similar unregistered tuition centres operated by other groups. ""It will apply across the board, to any religious group whether Muslim group, Jewish group, or Christian group who wants to operate this sort of provision in unsafe accommodation, in unhygienic and filthy accommodation. ""It will apply to all religious groups, I want to make that absolutely clear,"" Sir Michael told the BBC. The education secretary has now said she intends to go further. ""I have now asked Ofsted to prepare cases for prosecution against unregistered schools it has identified. For a child to spend a single day in one of these schools is unacceptable.""

"Media playback is not supported on this device But the Uruguay striker, 27, can now train and play in friendly matches, with new club Barcelona confirming: ""He will join the first team's training session, scheduled for Friday. ""The public presentation of Suarez as a new Barcelona player will be held on Monday at the Camp Nou."" It is not known if he will play in Monday's game with Mexico's Club Leon. A full explanation of the Cas ruling, which still prevents him from playing ""organised"" matches but now allows him to take part in all ""football-related activities"", will be published at a later date. He will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-match ban in competitive international games, while his competitive Barcelona debut is likely to be at Real Madrid on 26 October in El Clasico. But Suarez will now be available for Uruguay's friendlies against Japan and South Korea in September and Saudi Arabia the following month. Suarez's lawyers argued that world governing body Fifa's decision to suspend him from all football-related activity for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 2014 World Cup group match in Brazil in June was too strong a punishment. Switzerland-based Cas - an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations - said: ""The sanctions imposed on the player by Fifa have been generally confirmed."" But it said preventing Suarez from taking part in any football activity was ""excessive"", as not allowing him to train would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended. World players' union Fifpro said it was ""disappointed that the court had decided not to strongly diminish the sanctions"" and ""remain of the view they are disproportionate in relation to his violation of the Fifa disciplinary code"". It added: ""We regret Cas not deciding to reduce the length of Suarez's bans in exchange for an obligation for him to receive treatment."" In addition to being allowed to train and play in friendlies, the former Liverpool player - who moved to Barcelona last month for £75m - can also attend matches and take part in promotional activities. His legal team said the appeal was a success, arguing Fifa had ""misapplied its own rules when considering the case and the sanction it imposed was disproportionate"". Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: ""Luis Suarez's appeal against a four-month ban has failed. He is though, sensibly I think, now allowed to train with the team."" ""By allowing Suarez to train, Cas appears to have taken into account the club's interests and has emphasised any appropriate sanction for such incidents should be proportionate,"" said Hannah Clipston, a lawyer specialising in resolving disputes. ""What is proportionate for a repeat offender is different to what is proportionate for a first time offender."" Suarez apologised nearly a week after the incident, despite initially claiming to have lost his balance. He was previously suspended for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. In 2011, he was also given an eight-match suspension and fined £40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.","The passage discusses the recent decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding the ban imposed on Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez following his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup. While the initial ban prevented him from all football-related activities, the CAS has now allowed him to train and play in friendly matches. However, he still has to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-match ban in competitive international games. The CAS decision is seen as a partial victory for Suarez, as it allows him to maintain his fitness levels and prepare for his competitive debut with his new club, Barcelona. The exact reasons for the CAS decision will be published at a later date. The ban was initially imposed by FIFA, and Suarez's lawyers argued that it was too strong a punishment. The world players' union, Fifpro, expressed disappointment that the sanctions were not strongly diminished, viewing them as disproportionate. Suarez's legal team considered the appeal a success, arguing that FIFA had misapplied its own rules.

"Stephen Hammond said job roles would change when the paper system for car tax discs is scrapped in October. The minister allayed fears about job losses in a letter to Swansea East AM Mike Hedges. Mr Hedges said the minister's response would ""give comfort"" to DVLA employees. Concerns over the future of some of the 5,000 workers at the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency centre were raised in October after Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement. The chancellor announced that the tax disc would be replaced with an electronic system in October 2014. The new system will allow people to pay the charge by monthly direct debit. Mr Hedges had written to Mr Hammond asking for clarification of the government's intentions. In his response to Mr Hedges, Mr Hammond said: ""It is likely that the introduction of a direct debit scheme may mean there will be a natural reduction in the amount of refunds received, in addition to the withdrawal of the tax disc. ""This may mean changes to job roles and the need to train on new processes. ""Any reductions in numbers of people needed for these activities will be managed through redeploying to other growth areas of the business."" Mr Hedges welcomed the minister's assurances. He added: ""Whilst disappointed that the changes will reduce the number of job opportunities at the DVLA, I can see the advantages of both paying by monthly direct debits and not having to show a tax disc.

The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law. Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros. Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months. Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: ""No. Why should we? ""These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues."" The minister added that ""my Polish colleague"" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary. EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously. Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports. Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law.

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","Adrian Gill, a well-known journalist and author, passed away after being diagnosed with cancer.

The rapper had taken to the stage in a red deel - a Mongolian robe - embroidered with a swastika. Though associated with the Nazis, the swastika is a traditional symbol in Mongolia that pre-dates Hitler. Mr Sukhbaatar's father, Sevjidiin Sukhbaatar, told a news conference that his son spent about 10 days in a coma after the beating. ""My son was hit in the face several times with a metal object and was seriously injured. His brain was seriously hurt,"" he said.

But seamers Matt Taylor and Craig Miles made sure wickets fell at regular intervals in cloudy conditions in the Welsh capital. Gloucestershire struggled in turn as the bowlers remained on top all day. Selman's century, after being dropped on eight in the first over, was a welcome return to form for the Brisbane-born opener after a string of low scores following his hundred against Northants at Swansea.

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270.

They are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four. If they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers. But not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick. Part of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault. Where he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front. Between them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season. With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up. But he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system. Looking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough. It is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team. That means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes. Doing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight. In their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games. They look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault. When I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield. Again, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once. Another problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team. More than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically. Sadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem. Liverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right. From Mamadou Sakho for £18m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for £20m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer. They still look all over the place at the back. Statistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better. Liverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected. What Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there. Simon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box. Rodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea. He was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it. Liverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home. Now he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays. My team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini. For me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu. It is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough. It is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet He was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season. Although he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea. To compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack. Whether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back. That way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks. Going forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed. The trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli. He will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy. Even if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment. Jose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either. The only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric. The Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points. There is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans. Whatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished. He was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future. Playing in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club. The older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one. At 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle. What he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively. Because, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that ""his legs have gone"". Of course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test. What happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside But it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation. As you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone. There is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't. I knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them. What does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself. I knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer. For me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players. Of all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with. He was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen. Saturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside. Of course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him. It would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does. It is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too.

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme.

"The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000. The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe. In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection. Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus. It can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost. That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes. The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece. The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy. ""Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc. ""Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,"" he told BBC News. Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida. The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the ""revolution"" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan. The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year. Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace. The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight. More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth. There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade. OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage. Equity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a ""truly global company"" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority. ""A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,"" said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger. ""And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries."" One aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions. The fear is that space could eventually become unusable. A recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other. Brian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation. ""We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,"" he told BBC News. ""We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit."" Time will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole. Airbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment. ""Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,” said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.

The project requires a significant shift in satellite manufacturing, focusing on high volume and low cost. Airbus and OneWeb have established an assembly line in Toulouse, France, with plans for two more in Florida. The first 10 satellites are set to launch in April 2023, with over 800 expected to be in orbit by the mid-2020s. The project faces challenges in obtaining necessary financing and dealing with potential space debris. The UK Space Agency is involved as the project has a company registration in the Channel Islands. The project aims to set new standards in debris mitigation, committing to de-orbit old spacecraft within two years. The new manufacturing approaches could potentially disrupt the satellite industry.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.66931,0.12826,0.05556,0,1.0
"Mr Swinney said the UK government's recent spending review placed ""unprecedented pressure"" on public expenditure north of the border. The UK government said Scottish ministers would have £390m more in spending available to them next year. Mr Swinney is due to present his 2016-17 spending plans on Wednesday. The Scottish government argues that cuts imposed by the UK government since 2010 - along with last month's spending review - mean that its discretionary budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms by 2019-20 than it was in 2010-11. Mr Swinney said 4.2% of that reduction would come between now and 2019-20. He said: ""The chancellor (George Osborne) has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020, and more than £1bn of those cuts are still to come between now and the end of the decade. ""We have demonstrated that the UK government didn't have to take this approach. Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor. ""Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor's decision. We face tough choices in the coming days. ""Against this backdrop, the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on."" Mr Swinney said schools, hospitals and the police service in Scotland would ""not be sacrificed to the chancellor's austerity obsession"". He added: ""In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland. More police, lower crime, better schools, tuition-free university education and a health budget that is at a record level. ""These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government."" Responding to Mr Swinney comments, a spokesman for the UK government's Scotland Office said: ""The Scottish government will have £390m more spending available to it next year, which rises to £750m if you include its own underspend. ""The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £30bn. ""One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government. ""The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers and getting the best for Scotland, rather than grievance."" Labour's public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: ""Ahead of the most important budget since devolution, it's time John Swinney backed up his anti-austerity posturing with something real. ""Telling us about pre-election giveaways now and cuts later isn't good enough. This needs to be a long-term budget. ""Scotland needs a government that spends less time congratulating itself on its spin and more time explaining its record. ""Scottish Labour will offer a real alternative to austerity, with different decisions on tax to the Tories, and different decisions on tax to the SNP.""","The UK government's recent spending review has put significant pressure on public spending in Scotland, according to Mr Swinney.

"For many people with severe disabilities, their families and carers, this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house. In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven't got a suitable area to spend a penny. Ordinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet?"" Recommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory. Lorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory ""It's like playing Russian roulette,"" Lorna says. ""Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful. ""My daughter is only six so she doesn't have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through, but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty."" Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people. There are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they? They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet  the needs of people who use them. Mike LeSurf, Changing Places Development Officer at Mencap says: ""There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door, people's needs are not being met."" Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away. ""Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn't a bench and hoist in the toilet,"" she says. ""You just begin to get this sense of feeling like you're last in the line to be considered. ""It's soul-destroying and you don't feel like a valued member of society at all."" But it is not all doom and gloom and Alison gets by with a little help from her friends. She said: ""Freddie went to a party and one of my friends converted a room into a 'pop-up' changing places, and brought stuff from home to kit it out - it was amazing"" Alison even tweeted from the party: ""Friends for life are those who organise parties in the village hall and provide a 'pop up' #changingplace so ALL can go!"" Bethan Folen and her daughter Lowri also enjoy their ""girls' days out"" now there are more convenient and fully accessible places to change nearby. She said: ""Lowri's favourite thing to do is to go to the Millennium Stadium [now known as the Principality Stadium] in Cardiff and watch Wales play rugby. She is a massive fan. Even before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet, says Bethan, ""There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change Lowri"" Changing Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines (BS 8300:2009) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement. Architect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem. ""By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment,"" she says. ""As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this."" For businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans. At 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m). Because of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations. Arsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too. Alun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: ""There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt. ""But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience. ""They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible. ""You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important.""","The passage discusses the challenges faced by people with severe disabilities and their families when trying to find suitable toilet facilities in public places. Standard accessible toilets may not be sufficient for those who need assistance from multiple carers or a hoist to transfer onto a bench. The campaign for Changing Places toilets, which offer enhanced facilities, is highlighted. These toilets are recommended for larger buildings but are not yet compulsory. The emotional impact on families and the need for more inclusive facilities are also discussed. The passage also mentions the positive experiences of some businesses, like Arsenal Football Club, that have installed Changing Places toilets.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.97031,0.96777,0.99185,1,1.0

"The poster with the phrase #prayforjosh appeared in Holywood by the A2 within the last week. It is part of a social media campaign supporting 13-year-old Joshua Martin, from Donaghadee, County Down. Life took a dramatic turn for the teenager when he was diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Eve. He was due to have an operation on his appendix at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. However, doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller growths. The news shocked Josh's family, but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world. It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Elim Church, where Josh's father is on the pastoral staff, and has since gone viral. The church's senior pastor, Gary Beattie, said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far. ""We were in total shock when he was diagnosed, and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh,"" Gary said. ""It certainly isn't a campaign as such, we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him. We had no idea that it would take off.

Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure, saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805, home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke's Drift. ""This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way,"" he said. ""The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town. ""Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history, with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century. ""This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history."" Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision, saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales. He also hoped the closure would not damage the town's ""thriving"" military tourism industry. Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk. Mr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. Cawdor Barracks, Pembrokeshire - whose closure was previously announced in 2013 - will now shut in 2024, while a storage depot at Sennybridge will go in 2025.

"It also warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal. Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign. The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain. This dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June. Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway. However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry. Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it ""must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations"". What complicates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states. The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states. ""A successful industry,"" the report says, ""therefore needs continued market access."" However, that access may come at a price. ""Brexit will involve many trade-offs,"" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee. ""It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs."" The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states. One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away ""raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes"" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. However, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats. Just this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns. Responding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU. ""With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,"" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement. ""This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities."" In response to the report, a government spokesperson said: ""As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market."" ""At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment."" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook","The House of Lords has released a report discussing the potential impact of Brexit on the UK fishing industry. The industry, which makes up only 0.5% of the UK's GDP and employs 12,000 fishers, is at risk of being marginalized in the Brexit negotiations. The report highlights that the UK's commercial fish stocks are in shared waters with other EU coastal states, and that the UK exports most of its fish to the EU while importing a significant portion of the fish consumed by British consumers from the EU. The report also notes that the UK will need to continue to co-operate with neighboring states on fisheries management, even after leaving the EU. The report suggests that the UK may need to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal, and that the UK will need to continue to base total allowable catches and quotas on scientific advice.

"Ed Snowden, a 29-year-old former technical worker for the CIA, has since revealed himself to be the source of the leaks in an interview with the Guardian news website. US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as ""extremely damaging"" to national security, but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance ""horrifying"". What could the US government see? According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data of individuals. The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon, which included call duration, location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls. How much do the spooks know? Why every call matters What can you learn from phone records? According to the documents, Prism also enabled ""backdoor"" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple. These servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches. All the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works. National Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. ""If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said Some experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"". ""The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,"" he said. ""Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar."" What about data-protection laws? Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity. Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring. Facebook's privacy policy, for example, states: "" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities"". Are we all being watched? The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy. ""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran. Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""law abiding citizens"" in Britain would ""never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up"". Does it make a difference which country you live in? User data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being ""transferred to and stored in"" the US. The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way. This method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC. ""Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,"" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act. ""In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests."" Are other governments involved? UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism. It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007. In a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was ""concerned"" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was ""seeking more details"" from the US authorities. ""Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),"" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding. What does this mean for internet use? William Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of ""opting out"" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security. However privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its ""worst fears and suspicions"". ""Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,"" says  Privacy International on its website. ""The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse."" Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy. ""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of thingsâ€¦ I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,"" he told the Guardian.","The passage discusses the revelation of Edward Snowden, a former CIA technical worker, as the source of leaks about US surveillance programs.

Last year, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC AI could potentially ""re-design itself at an ever increasing rate"", superseding humans by outpacing biological evolution. However, other experts have argued that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote. A statement on OpenAI's website said the venture aims ""to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return"". ""It's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it's equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly."" The statement said AI ""should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as is possible safely"". It said only a tiny fraction of the $1bn pledged would be spent in the next few years.","The passage discusses the creation of OpenAI, a research organization backed by several high-profile tech figures and companies, including Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Infosys, and Amazon Web Services.

"However, since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation. In 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected, Indian-dominated coalition. This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy. A further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks. These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation. Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years. In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history. In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member. Fiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India. The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority. Mixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society. There are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans. Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing. Nonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid.","Since 1987, Fiji has experienced political instability and international isolation due to racial tensions between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians. Multiple coups have occurred, including one in 1987 that overthrew an Indian-dominated coalition, and another in 2000 where the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister was held hostage. These events negatively impacted the economy, particularly tourism, and led to Fiji's suspension from the Commonwealth in 2009.

"Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told the BBC ""Syria is doing its best"" to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons. Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over its entire stockpile. Mr Mekdad said a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia. ""We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast,"" he said. ""The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups."" He added: ""This is a serious business. Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration."" He described as ""absolutely unacceptable"" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters. Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area. ""We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians,"" Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of ""still supporting terrorist elements"" in the country. The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees. But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had ""thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups"". The Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison. It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions. Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons. The US said last week that so far only about 4% of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was ""concerned"" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus ""had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment"". Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March. A deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is overseeing the destruction operation, has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books.""

Several ships including two passenger ferries were sent to help. The passengers and crew on the life rafts eventually boarded one of the ferries, the Puglia. Spanish officials said the rescued passengers were on their way back to Palma de Mallorca and were expected to arrive at the port in a few hours' time. Psychologists were being asked to go to the port to provide counselling. ""Due to the fire that it has suffered, The Sorrento may sink in the position in which it finds itself,"" the Balearic Islands port authority said in a tweet (in Spanish). The ferry, owned by Italian company Atlantica di Navigazione, sent out distress signals at 13:50 local time (11:50 GMT), said Spain's Ministry of Public Works. At first, the ministry said the captain did not believe it would be necessary to abandon the ship but the fire became so intense that a full evacuation was called for.","The Sorrento, a ferry owned by Italian company Atlantica di Navigazione, was traveling to Valencia when a fire broke out on one of the car decks, causing the evacuation of all passengers.

"The Electoral Commission said 38 MPs had highlighted people, including students, claiming to have voted twice, which is a criminal offence. It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries. Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote. A record number of 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, 500,000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46.4 million figure for the EU referendum. Of these, 68.7% actually voted on the day, the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997. There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline. In total, 2.9 million applications were received over the six-week period. Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10%, including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury, Cambridge, Bristol West and Leeds Central. However, concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year's EU referendum - continue to persist. At the moment, there is no direct link between electoral registers, which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain, and the online registration service now used by a majority of people. The two systems use different databases and cannot communicate directly with each other. Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline, about 4.9 million applications to vote were submitted, the majority of them done online. But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1.4 million, suggesting ""a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates"". With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered, the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30% and 70% in different areas. The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites, including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland. Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May's local council elections, the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed. ""The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service, in comparison to the difficult of contacting a local authority electoral services team by telephone or email to check if they were already registered, meant many people simply submitted another application,"" the report said. Although there was a lack of evidence to back up claims on social media that some people had voted twice, the watchdog said it took the issue very seriously and anyone with information should contact the police. It stressed that although some people - including students and those with second homes - may lawfully be able to register in more than one constituency and cast more than one vote in local elections, voting twice in a general election was an offence punishable by an unlimited fine. The ""dispersed and unconnected"" nature of the 381 electoral registers in Britain means it is not possible to collectively cross-check entries, the watchdog said, and being able to do so would significantly reduce the risk of double voting. It is also calling for people who are registered in two seats to choose in advance which one they will vote in at future general elections. Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement, Cat Smith, said voting twice was a serious offence and police needed to have the resources to prosecute people suspected of doing so. But she warned against a knee-jerk reaction, given the rise in registration and turnout, particularly among younger voters. ""A blanket ban on being registered at two addresses would exclude those who for reasons of work or study need to be registered in two places,"" she said. ""This cannot be an attempt to make it harder for young people and students to register to vote.""","The Electoral Commission reported that 38 MPs identified individuals, including students, who allegedly voted twice in the 2017 general election, which is a criminal offense. The commission suggested improving the coordination between individual electoral registers managed by councils to better identify duplicate entries.

"Officials believe Lawrence Phillips, 40, killed himself early on Wednesday. In the 1990s, he was a star player at the University of Nebraska, making him a sought-after rookie in the NFL. Phillips played for the St Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers until 1999, but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field. After his NFL career, Phillips continued to have problems with the law. Eventually, he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers. In another case, he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend. Phillips, who was serving a term of more than 30 years, had been placed in a cell alone after he was accused of killing his former cellmate.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Emotion. Drama. Excitement. Brilliant football. Noise. Colour. And all this even before Liverpool's Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The Kop in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre. It was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's almost crazed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund, the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel. Liverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe's second-rate pot - not a label anyone was attaching to it after this classic. Liverpool into last four after Euro thriller Istanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp Liverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan When Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October, he revealed one of his priorities was to ""turn doubters into believers"". And it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory, both on the pitch and in the stands. If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened. In nine blistering minutes from the first whistle, this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart, with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration. Liverpool needed three goals, leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005, saying: ""Even if it is not likely it is possible, so we should try."" And yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice, Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes. It was time for believers, time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon. And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touchstone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren. Borussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw-dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up. It takes us back to more words from Klopp. After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early, saying it made him feel alone and adding: ""We decide when it's over."" This was a phrase that could have been stamped on the foreheads of Liverpool's players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do. If anyone entered Anfield as a doubter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left. This night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour, the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The Kop. Before the teams emerged, Anfield was serenaded by arguably the longest version of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" ever heard at the stadium, Gerry Marsden's voice turned off and Liverpool's supporters taking over, the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence. A minute's silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed, Anfield a cauldron of emotions. It was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages, cut to pieces by high-class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere. Slowly, after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit, the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were unnerved to the point where their resolve was broken. Klopp was a man possessed on the touchline, waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players, pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise. It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night. Tuchel said: ""When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change. There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be. Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmospheres ever at a football match."" Klopp added: ""It was brilliant, outstanding, emotional, everything. I will not forget it because it was special. I know this is a place for big football moments. We didn't start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories."" There was certainly a new, unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night. In the afterglow of such sporting brilliance, there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool's performance. It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed. And yet, when there is time for reflection, it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool. Divock Origi's goal, his fourth in his past three games, was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge. Even as Liverpool battled Dortmund's supremacy, Origi showed power, pace and a willingness to fight. Very much the Klopp template, recalling the words of his manager after his first game in charge at Tottenham six months ago: ""We're going to have a lot of fun with this player."" Media playback is not supported on this device Emre Can has had a mixed season but was outstanding before picking up an injury, while Coutinho sprinkles the stardust on this Liverpool team. It seems like splitting hairs after such a glorious spectacle, but Liverpool still have a vulnerability at the back that will surely be addressed by Klopp in the summer. Alberto Moreno is a weak link at left-back and while Sakho may be a popular figure with supporters, talking of ""a win for the Liverpool country"" and taking selfies on the pitch with Origi, close inspection suggests his positional play was something of an adventure for Dortmund's goals. One thing is clear, however, and qualifies as the biggest plus of all - in the space of six months Klopp has imprinted his identity on his new players and Liverpool's fans. The evidence was all over Anfield. Most definitely - indeed many felt the winner of this tie would go on to claim the trophy. It was not a notion welcomed or encouraged by Klopp. Sevilla, winners for the last two seasons, still lurk after beating Athletic Bilbao on penalties while another Spanish side Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up a high-powered last four. But there is almost the spirit of Champions League 2005 about Liverpool's run in the Europa League. Back then Liverpool moved along with no great expectation to not only find themselves in the final but winning it. Klopp will guard against any complacency but the way in which Liverpool pulled off an extraordinary feat on Thursday will give them growing confidence that no task is too onerous for them at Anfield in the semi-finals. The Europa League is not the only prize within reach - a return to the Champions League via victory in this tournament is now tantalisingly coming into view. The famous ""This Is Anfield"" sign has greeted players on the path to the pitch for decades - many touch it for luck and Klopp even did so himself on a visit to the stadium for a friendly when coach of Borussia Dortmund. It carries an aura but Klopp has put a banning order on his players, saying: ""I've told my players you need to win something before you touch the 'This Is Anfield'. It's a sign of respect. You don't do it - it is too big."" Klopp has delivered another incentive to his Liverpool charges.","The passage describes a thrilling 4-3 victory by Liverpool over Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League, a match that will be remembered as one of the greatest dramas at Anfield. The game was marked by an incredible comeback from Liverpool, who were down 2-0 within the first nine minutes, but managed to turn the game around with three goals in the last 33 minutes. The victory was a testament to the team's spirit and belief, as well as the passionate support of their fans. The win moved Liverpool closer to earning a place in the Champions League, and was seen as a significant moment in Jurgen Klopp's tenure as manager.

Mr Davis said he wanted to hold a monthly meeting to share analysis as part of a ""two-way information flow"" with each of the three nations. He believed that would allow the devolved administrations to voice their views as the Westminster government prepares talks with Brussels.

""Naturally, there are different standpoints around the table, but the meeting was constructive and amicable.

""We will work positively with the Scottish government, the Welsh government and the Northern Ireland Executive as we implement the decision of the people of the UK to leave the EU."" Mr Russell said it was ""good"" that the process of involving the Scottish government was under way.

This will remain a considerable problem as we continue to promote the interests of Scotland. ""The UK Government must provide greater clarity and transparency on its intentions.""

"""I'm feeling the joints for any kind of heat or swelling."" Veterinary surgeon Dr Sandra Corr puts Daisy the sheep through a very hands-on physical examination. ""I'm looking for any signs of crepitus or lameness,"" she says, ""Anything that might indicate the onset of disease or osteoarthritis."" But Daisy is not just any sheep. She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996. This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters. ""Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,"" he says. We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests. As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation. But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world. According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results. He tells me: ""One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?"" Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some ""age-memory"" might be transferred into the next generation. ""That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,"" says Prof Sinclair. ""A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age."" The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down. But by then Dolly was already suffering from osteoarthritis which, although not unheard of in a sheep of her age, did raise concerns about premature aging. The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more clones. ""We wanted to know if Dolly's untimely death was just unlucky"", recalled Prof Sinclair, ""or if it was something to do with the cloning process itself. If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cloned animals."" Getting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dollies, and nine other sheep cloned from different cell lines, through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-body fMRI scans. Prof Sinclair said: ""We focused on three co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoarthritis - the three co-morbidities most associated with aging. Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-morbidities."" The results of the study, which could have profound implications for the future of cloning, will be published next week. But for now, the dollies, which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays, seem to be in rude health.

"They range from extra responsibility for off-street parking, through to tourism. Potentially, though, the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions. Councils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas. Currently, if you want to build a new house or erect an extension, you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service, an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont's environment department. Planning officials refer your application to your local council. The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application, but the final say rests with the Planning Service. From April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves, meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions. So is this a positive move, democratising our planning system? Michael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE, is optimistic. Mr Corr already works with councils and government departments, providing advice on new developments like leisure centres. He told me the move is ""a huge opportunity for the future, which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans"". But do Northern Ireland's politicians have the necessary skills? Speaking about voters, Mr Corr said: ""They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues, because it's those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference."" However, not everyone is so upbeat. Back in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing. Protests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement. The environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent. James Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: ""In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities."" Mr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a ""tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here"". He said: ""It's quite easy to see that continuing, where we get a laissez-faire system which says, 'you look after your community and we won't bother engaging in proper democratic planning' . That is a real danger and that's why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place."" Friends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties. Some local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security. Others argue that the Â£7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts. Under the terms of a law passed earlier this year, it's up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations.","The passage discusses the shift of planning decision-making power from the Planning Service to local councils in Northern Ireland, set to take place in April 2015. This move will allow councils to accept or reject developments in their own areas, with the potential to positively impact community and development plans. However, concerns have been raised about the fairness and transparency of this system, given the history of discrimination in housing allocation and close relationships between developers and political parties. Friends of the Earth argue for the importance of transparency in political donations to ensure proper democratic planning. The Northern Ireland Secretary will decide when to reveal more information about political donations.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.94172,0.96868,0.99309,1,1.0
"The animal had been shot twice in the shoulder and once in its left back leg, which vets had to amputate. The charity said the one-year-old cat was ""incredibly lucky"" to survive. Last year the Scottish government held a consultation on licensing air weapons, but a majority of responders opposed the plan. One-year-old Teenie was found injured by her owner Sarah Nisbett in NiddryView, Winchburgh, at about 16:30 on Friday 14 March and taken to the Scottish SPCA. Mrs Nisbett said the cat was now having to learn how to walk again. ""The gun that was used must have some power because the pellet actually went through her back leg, that's why it was so badly damaged,"" she said. ""She's now learning how to hop around the house, it's terrible. ""The fact that it was three shots is crazy. We live in a housing estate and there are lots of kids. That just makes it worse because any of them could have been hit in the crossfire."" She added: ""There's some sick people out there, hopefully somebody will know who's done this and let the police or the Scottish SPCA know."" Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said: ""Teenie's owners are understandably very upset and keen for us to find the callous person responsible to ensure no more cats come to harm. ""This is an alarming incident which only highlights why the Scottish government should implement the licensing of airguns as a matter of urgency."" He added: ""The new licensing regime should ensure that only those with a lawful reason are allowed to possess such a dangerous weapon. It will also help the police trace anyone using an air gun irresponsibly."" Last year the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons, with a large majority of those who responded opposing the plan. Under the proposed scheme, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Benteke becomes the Reds' second most expensive signing, on what the club describe as a ""long-term contract"". Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad.

"But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. ""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"". The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. ""I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,"" said Mr Mason.","The passage discusses a study on the use of tablet devices in schools, which found that 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools use tablets to some extent, with 9% of schools having a device for every pupil.

"The exhibition Growing Up in the City at the Museum of Liverpool boasts 25 evocative photographs which capture the life of children over more than 100 years. As well as a providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood, the pictures also provide a thought-provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades. The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets. The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park. The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard. As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work. A nervous looking young maid for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900. The exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones, Curator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool. Ms Jones painstakingly trawled through hundreds of images from the National Museums Liverpool's collections before deciding on the final 25 for the exhibition. She said: ""This has been a fascinating exhibition to work on. ""Looking through hundreds of different postcards, photographs and glass plate negatives in our collections; it was hard to decide on the final 25 images. ""I chose the ones that really stood out and told the experience of childhood.

"It decided to reorganise the way patients were diagnosed by GPs and specialists by bringing in a new approach, especially to deal with those cancer cases which are not initially obvious. A team of cancer specialists, GPs, NHS and public health experts from Wales have just returned from a fact-finding visit to Aarhus, Denmark's second city. So what was the problem? Prof Frede Olesen of Aarhus University said the changes followed ""quite alarming"" cancer survival statistics more than 15 years ago showing Denmark was performing poorly compared to other European countries, including the rest of Scandinavia. Part of the problem was that waiting times patients faced before getting diagnosed were too long. It was not so much the most serious cases where patients came to the GP with obvious symptoms. They could be fast-tracked to specialists in hospital. It was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out. ""We looked at 30,000 cancer cases - and more than 25% of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn't think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it's important to find those cases,"" said Prof Olesen. What were the changes? The model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes. First -  for patients with "" alarm"" symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast-track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets. In addition to that, by law, any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral. Second, the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs cannot diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them, whether it is cancer or something else. GP Dr Hanne Heje, who works in Aarhus - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer. It also stops the ""ping pong"" between GPs and different specialists. ""Now we know there's a department meeting the patient with open arms saying 'we welcome you', even though there's not a diagnosis written on their forehead,"" she said. The third route deals with the group of patients with minor symptoms, which are very unlikely to be cancer but in rare cases could be. These patients go to so-called ""yes-no"" centres which offer a simple test or scan so they can be seen quickly and any problems identified. ""This can be solved within hours in some cases but 1% will have a serious disease and this can be detected,"" said Prof Olesen. ""For these patients before - they might have had to wait four to six months, so for the small percentage where something is found, they'd start treatment six months behind the time schedule."" The results so far Prof Olesen - a former GP himself - said the changes have not led to a ""flooding of the system"" by more GP referrals but better organisation of how patients are diagnosed within existing resources. Importantly, he says it has also led to better survival rates. ""We've got very optimistic results showing Norway, Sweden and Finland are becoming better year by year,"" he said. ""But very clearly in the data Denmark is becoming better, a faster pace than before and catching up and getting closer to where we should be."" Denmark has a similar health system in how it is funded and organised to Wales. He said there could be lessons shared between Wales and Denmark on how better organisation can help ""in catching up the elite in Europe"". Dr Tom Crosby, medical director of the Wales Cancer Network, said he had been impressed with how the Danish health service had broken down the barriers between GPs and specialists to work better together. He said: ""People are not just doing tests in isolation - they are working together to achieve a diagnosis.""","The passage describes a new approach to diagnosing cancer cases in Denmark, particularly those that are not initially obvious.

"Management body NHS Employers has given the plan the green light after advisers said there were a range of extra tasks they could do with more training. A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs. But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS. It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rotas, while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors. NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-strong workforce could be reshaped to help. The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting. These included: The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages, such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care, with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them. It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff, but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened. Are nurses the new doctors?

And NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer said: ""Our challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report.""

"Earlier this month, NRW estimated the lagoon would mean 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout dying each year, as they migrate to and from local rivers. Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) said the claims had no ""clear scientific basis"". NRW said its figures were based on the ""best available evidence"" it received. In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales, TLP disputed NRW's figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them. ""Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these 'what if' scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication,"" the briefing said. ""These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures [on fish],"" the briefing adds. TLP said that computer modelling carried out by experts on its behalf estimated a ""worst case scenario"" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish.

"It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud. The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented. However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice. One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option. The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before. They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app. If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase. They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out. While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service. That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker. Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's ""forensic"" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad. ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was ""the only one able to do that"". He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used. ""I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,"" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account. ""The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled."" However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system. ""The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,"" he said. ""And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back. ""Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies."" But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test. ""We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it. ""And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too."" Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it ""plans to more aggressively encourage people"" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords. ""When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,"" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper. ""I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.""","The passage discusses Apple's implementation of a two-step verification system for its iCloud service to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access to users' intimate photos. The system requires users to enter a four-digit code sent to a trusted device in addition to their username and password when logging in from a new device. This security measure was previously available but did not apply to the backup service. The change comes after reports of third-party software, such as Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker, being used to steal celebrities' private photos from iCloud. The new system is an opt-in choice, and users are advised to keep a 14-character recovery key to regain access to their accounts in case of loss or theft of their trusted device. Despite the improvements, there are concerns about the recovery key being lost or stolen, and some experts suggest that Apple should make two-factor authentication the default option instead of recommending it.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.94931,0.96828,0.98609,1,1.0

"That report was never written, but the murdered opposition politician's colleagues, led by his close associate Ilya Yashin, have since worked to finish it. Most of the Russian-language report, entitled Putin. War, is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine. But its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends. Russia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, arguing that any Russians serving there are ""volunteers"". But Mr Yashin, who presented the report, said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk. ""All the separatists' key successes were secured by Russian army units,"" he said. ""The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory, admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation. There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident."" The dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine. A Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (Â£1,250-1,900) a month. Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles (Â£665m; $1bn): Boris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year, after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation. But those relatives never went public and, after his assassination, have become even more scared. Names and numbers of military units are documented, along with photos of weaponry, although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken. How many Russians are fighting in Ukraine? BBC team attacked while investigating soldiers' deaths Russian families look for soldier sons Mr Yashin said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies. But publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said. And above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia? There are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev. But the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity. In this, they admit he was successful. And it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov. Critics of Mr Putin praised Mr Nemtsov's reports on corruption in the president's entourage and on the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. But they failed to galvanise protests against him.","The passage discusses a report, ""Putin.

However, the relatives never went public, and after Nemtsov's assassination, they became even more scared.

"Although there is some common ground between the two governments on, for example, the need for free trade within the single market, Carwyn Jones has complained that he didn't see the letter before it was published on Wednesday.

""I should be clear, though, that I didn't see the letter before today and we were not invited to contribute to its drafting. This is unacceptable and is the culmination of a deeply frustrating process in which the devolved administrations have persistently been treated with a lack of respect. ""It is all the more regrettable given the UK government's stated aim was to develop a negotiating framework for the whole of the UK."" Mr Jones may have been playing to an audience, but Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns hit back: ""I'm a bit disappointed in that. The prime minister has been in Wales three times in the last six weeks. ""We've been talking about the contents of this letter for many months. ""We've clearly all made our representations but, ultimately, the UK government needs to act in the interests of the whole of the UK and that's what we're doing, specifically with Wales being mentioned."" Mrs May did indeed mention Wales in the letter. She told Donald Tusk: ""When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. ""But it is the expectation of the government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration."" That sentence may have been written more with Scotland in mind, but it does prompt the question: which powers? Farming? Economic aid? And will the money follow the powers? Alun Cairns wouldn't answer those questions, although Carwyn Jones has said he fears there won't be any money to accompany the powers after 2020. (Perhaps Mr Jones doesn't think Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year - Labour has pledged to maintain EU funding levels on regional aid beyond 2020). Some in Whitehall think the way EU money has been spent in Wales - check out Nick Clegg's film from Ebbw Vale - is an argument for transferring those powers to Westminster, but that looks politically less likely now. We may get some more details about the process in a white paper on the Great Repeal Bill on Thursday but, at the moment, the identity of the powers the UK government wants to see devolved is something of a mystery.","The passage discusses the issue of the UK government not sharing the Article 50 letter with the Welsh government before publishing it, which Carwyn Jones, the First Minister of Wales, finds unacceptable.

Alun Cairns, the Welsh Secretary, defends the UK government's actions, stating that they have been discussing the letter's contents for months. The passage also mentions that the UK government plans to consult on which powers should be devolved to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland after Brexit, but the specific powers in question are not identified.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.87774,0.77497,0.91795,1,1.0

"Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. “Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?” This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.","The passage describes the launch of the iPhone in 2007 and its subsequent impact on society. The author initially struggled to obtain the device for a news piece but was eventually able to do so.

However, the author compares its significance to that of the Model T Ford, suggesting it would revolutionize the way people live. In the decade since its release, the iPhone has become a transformative technology, putting powerful computers in the hands of billions and disrupting various industries.

"No demos on the streets of Athens - even though the Syriza government is poised to agree and implement yet more austerity and liberalisation measures, mandated by creditors and of the ilk that till recently it characterised as hateful. And Greece's resorts are teeming: Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington (home of the IMF). Maybe holidaymakers were hoping to be on the ground for euro break-up history. Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State. But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition? Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â‚¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country. Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year. Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (""there is no alternative""). What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity. Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend. Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me). There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people. So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead. Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half. So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.","The passage discusses the current political and economic situation in Greece, where the Syriza government is set to implement more austerity measures mandated by creditors. Despite these measures, which have been previously criticized by Syriza, there is a lack of public protests. The passage suggests that this may be due to the public's anticipation of the details of the new bailout agreement, which is expected to be revealed later in the week. The agreement is expected to include painful VAT increases, pension cuts, reductions in farm subsidies, and controversial privatisations. The passage also notes that despite the economic hardships, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras remains popular. However, the continued closure of banks and lack of credit is expected to further harm the economy. The passage concludes by suggesting that for the new bailout to be successful, creditors will need to ease Greece's debt burden and avoid triumphalism in the face of Greece's capitulation.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.91489,0.95101,0.95616,1,1.0

"French firm EDF, which is financing most of the £18bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset, approved the funding at a board meeting. Contracts were to be signed on Friday. But Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the government will ""consider carefully"" before backing it. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz has cancelled a trip to Hinkley Point on Friday following Mr Clark's comments. Critics of the plan have warned of environmental damage and potential escalating costs. They are also concerned that the plant is being built by foreign governments. One third of the £18bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors. Hours after EDF's board voted to approve the £18bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project. This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact. EDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished. Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy? Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible. ""We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies,"" he said. ""Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments."" Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was ""yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties"". Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement. Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as ""a unique asset for French and British industries"", saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment. However, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity. Despite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners. Earlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise €4bn (£3.4bn) to help pay for the project. Ahead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was ""very risky"" financially. Earlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself. 5,600 workers on site at peak 4,000km electrical cabling 230,000 tonnes of steel 5.6m cubic metres of earth to be moved Environmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: ""Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money. He added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, ""doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians"". The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind. Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mix Mar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approved Oct 2013 - UK government agrees £92.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the time Oct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn.","The French firm EDF has approved the funding for the £18bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset, but the UK government has announced a further review of the project, causing a delay in the signing of contracts.

"The newly-designed form, used to apply for a divorce in England and Wales, asks for the name ""of the person your spouse has committed adultery with"". Family lawyers say that, in most cases, involving a third party adds ""conflict and complexity"". The Ministry of Justice said there was ""no obligation"" to name people. Lawyer Margaret Heathcote, vice-chairwoman of family law group Resolution, is one of those concerned about the form. ""Generally speaking, we don't name the third party. It increases the conflict from day one,"" she said. ""There's no need. But because the box is there, the indication will be to fill it in."" The online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice.

But Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers, Vardags, said people are ""unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it"". The older version of the form left a space for so-called ""co-respondents"" to be named where appropriate. ""The new form flatly asks for 'the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with',"" Ms Hamblin explained. ""This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse."" If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case. They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs.

""Unreasonable behaviour"" accounted for 46,815. Ms Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery ""want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them"".

"They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy ""sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment"". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as ""sexier"" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. ""There's a huge market for our timber. Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill,"" he added.","The passage discusses the conflict between the environmental and commercial aspects of forestry in Wales.

The Russian Embassy wrote to survivors in May 2012 that it intended to award them with the Medal of Ushakov as a symbol of the country's gratitude. But the move was blocked by the Foreign Office as its rules stated British soldiers could not receive a foreign medal if the act happened more than five years ago. The British Government created the Arctic Star in 2012 following a long campaign for the convoy veterans to be recognised. But campaigners believed veterans should still be able to receive the Russian accolade. The Foreign Office allowed an ""exception to the rules"" last year and President Vladimir Putin presented the first medals during his visit to London on 16 June 2013.

"HM Inspectorate of Probation found delays in getting offenders to start their work, and said too many were let off if they did not attend. In one case, an offender had completed just 16 hours in the 17 months since he had been sentenced. The Ministry of Justice said it was acting on the report's recommendations. Anything from 40 to 300 hours of unpaid work - or ""community payback"" - may be given for offences like shoplifting, theft, drug offences, or criminal damage. Some 70,000 offenders were ordered to do unpaid work such as garden maintenance, decorating or litter-picking in 2014. Inspectors looked at 100 cases and interviewed 86 offenders from different probation divisions for their report. The report outlined 15 recommendations for improvement. Some of the problems identified were: Seven years ago the government, then led by Gordon Brown, placed an order for 10,000 orange bibs. They were to be worn by offenders doing unpaid work under a re-branded scheme known as ""community payback"". It was intended to give the public confidence that community sentences, involving clearing communal paths and gardens, picking up litter and painting over graffiti, were a ""tough"" alternative to imprisonment. When the coalition came to power in 2010 it promised to make unpaid work more physical and intense, with unemployed offenders required to complete their sentences more quickly. The difficulty has always been organisation. Getting people who lead chaotic lives - many of them with drink or drug problems - to work on time is a task in itself. If sanctions are applied, they will end up in prison; if not, the sentence cannot be enforced. As the inspection report reveals, it is a problem the authorities still have not solved. Inspectors did praise instances of high-quality work, and cases where offenders believed they had gained skills from using good tools and equipment. They also highlighted that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and ""were determined to... desist from future offending"". Among its recommendations were that community rehabilitation companies should reduce how often offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time, and to try to create objectives for unpaid work that ""match the circumstances of the offender"". The chief inspector of probation, Paul Wilson, said it appeared in most cases that unpaid work was viewed simply as a punishment, which was a ""wasted opportunity"". ""Although we found some high-quality management and delivery, much of it was simply not good enough, lacking in focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court."" He called for ""urgent remedial action"". A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it wanted ""much more effective rehabilitation"" - which had to start with making sure offenders turned up on time and faced consequences if they did not. ""It's totally unacceptable for offenders to skip work enforced by the courts. ""We accept all the recommendations for the Ministry of Justice in this report and are already taking action to implement them.""","The HM Inspectorate of Probation found issues with the implementation of unpaid work sentences for offenders, including delays in starting the work and a lack of consequences for non-attendance.

The report made 15 recommendations for improvement, including reducing the frequency of offenders being turned away and creating objectives for unpaid work that match the offender's circumstances.

"The paper ran a front page headline calling the comedian a ""hypocrite"" because he campaigns for economic and political ""revolution"" to help poorer people, yet he lives in a luxury home. It's an accusation often made against the star. How can such a rich man claim to speak up for the poor? Viewers of Brand's vlogs - The Trews - are familiar with the inside of his spacious London home. It looks lovely and airy. It has wooden floors and exposed brickwork. When the St Trinian's star was outside the prime minister's Downing Street home - supporting a campaign by residents of an east London estate who fear they will be turfed out of their homes to allow richer renters to move in - Brand was asked about his own accommodation by a TV reporter. ""Part of the problem is the super-rich buying property in London, isn't it? What kind of rent are you paying?"" Brand wasn't very happy with the question. He called the Channel 4 News journalist ""a snide"", before walking off. Newsbeat contacted Brand to see if he was really going to take legal action against The Sun and its owner Rupert Murdoch. He didn't reply, though he has been tweeting about The Sun and it's accusations of hypocrisy - using the hashtag #TheSunLogic. The star's been condemned as a hypocrite plenty of times before.

There is no doubt that I as much as anyone have to change. ""Revolution is change. I believe in change, personal change most of all. Know, too that I have seen what fame and fortune have to offer and I know it's not the answer. ""Of course I have to change as an individual and part of that will be sharing wealth, though without systemic change, that will be a sweet, futile gesture."" ""I can't deny that I've done a lot of daft things while I was under the capitalist fugue, some silly telly, soppy scandals, movies better left unmade. ""It's easy to attack me, I'm a right twerp, I'm a junkie and a cheeky monkey, I accept it, but that doesn't detract from the incontrovertible fact that we are living in a time of huge economic disparity and confronting ecological disaster."" ""Now I'm rich and I complain about inequality they say I'm a hypocrite. I'm beginning to think they just don't want inequality on the agenda because it is a real problem that needs to be addressed.""

"The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community. Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. ""Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,"" he was once quoted as saying. And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts. But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process. After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form. Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science. Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict. As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive. This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted. ""Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,"" he said. During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes. But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough. Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally. He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates. His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work ""any monkey"" could do. The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research. And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis. His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme. Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles. Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure. In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal. But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt. The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins. The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that. ""I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,"" he said of the synthetic microbes. ""If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.""","The passage describes the life and scientific achievements of J. Craig Venter, a biologist and entrepreneur, who is known for his work in human genomics and the creation of a synthetic life form, Synthia. Venter's unconventional approach to science, which often involved private funding and competition with public projects, led to significant advancements in the field, but also brought him criticism from the scientific community. His work on decoding genes and the human genome, as well as his efforts to create synthetic life, have been met with both controversy and recognition. Venter's motivation for his work is attributed to his experiences during the Vietnam War, which instilled in him a sense of urgency and a determination to become a doctor. Despite the criticism, Venter's contributions to the field of genomics and synthetic biology have been significant, and he has been involved in various projects, including the exploration of marine microbes and their genomes.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.68996,0.89218,0.98104,1,1.0

"In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the ice fields slipping down Mont Blanc and the surrounding mountains of the European range covered some 375 sq km. By the late 2000s, this area had fallen to about 275 sq km. The research has been presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists. It mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations, but predominantly Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, France, and Italy. The new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gardent, from the University of Savoie, and colleagues. It assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, as well as the famous Mont Blanc Massif in the north. The team drew upon map archives, past satellite imagery and aerial photographs.  Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct. ""We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,"" explained Ms Gardent. ""Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins."" The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km. By 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows. Since then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s. This represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif. ""The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,"" Ms Gardent emphasised. ""We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud."" The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Efforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region. At this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.

""Nothing more sinister or serious than some tweets has occurred or been alleged to have occurred. None of the tweets involved are in ANY way threatening, not even in a joking sense. That's all we'll be saying on the subject at this time.""","Stuart Campbell, a Scottish blogger and campaigner for Scottish independence, was arrested in the west of England following a complaint from a woman in south London. She alleged that he had harassed her over a two-year period. Campbell, who was released on bail, stated that the allegations concerned some tweets, which he insisted were not threatening. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the matter. Campbell accused the media of encouraging speculations and innuendo. He has been a vocal campaigner for Scottish independence and launched the Wings Over Scotland blog in 2011.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.99889,0.71367,0.90031,1,1.0
"People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) wants the mascot to be replaced with a modern animal-friendly version. The group has suggested a fish with the slogan Skegness - A Happy Plaice. The mayor of Skegness said all suggestions were welcome but said he did not think there would be much support for Jolly to be axed. The original Jolly Fisherman poster was commissioned by the Great Northern Railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to Skegness. The poster featured the slogan ""Skegness is so bracing"". It was commissioned in 1908 for 12 guineas and has became synonymous with the Lincolnshire resort. However, Dawn Carr, of Peta, said Jolly ""evokes images of cruelty to animals"". ""Fish being tricked into impaling themselves in the mouth, animals being pulled out of the ocean in giant nets where they are so crushed together the pressure pushes their stomachs out through their mouths and their eyes pop out."" ""This is what the Jolly Fisherman represents,"" she said. She said Peta's suggestion would give the resort an opportunity to rebrand itself as a progressive holiday destination. ""One where the mutilation and killing of sea animals is not being celebrated."" Skegness's mayor, Carl Macey, said the Jolly Fisherman was loved by adults and children alike. He said: ""Animal cruelty is something we don't want to be portrayed for, but I don't feel Jolly has ever come across in that manner. ""He is just accepted as happy and friendly and he does such a wonderful job for Skegness. ""It [Peta's suggestion] will go before council, but if it isn't broken we won't try and fix it.""","PETA has proposed replacing the Jolly Fisherman mascot of Skegness with a fish, called ""A Happy Plaice,"" to promote a more animal-friendly image. PETA argues that the current mascot represents cruelty to animals in the fishing industry. However, the mayor of Skegness is open to suggestions but believes there is little support for replacing the beloved mascot, which has been associated with the town since 1908. The proposal will be considered by the council.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.98626,0.6422,0.79289,1,1.0
"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. ""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

"It also warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal.Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign.The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations.The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain.This dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June.Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway.However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry.Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it ""must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations"".What complicates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states. The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states.""A successful industry,"" the report says, ""therefore needs continued market access.""However, that access may come at a price.""Brexit will involve many trade-offs,"" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee.""It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs.""The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states.One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away ""raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes"" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.However, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.Just this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns.Responding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.""With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,"" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement.""This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.""In response to the report, a government spokesperson said: ""As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market.""""At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.""Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook","The House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report discussing the potential impact of Brexit on the UK fishing industry.

"Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told the BBC ""Syria is doing its best"" to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons.Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over its entire stockpile.Mr Mekdad said a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia.""We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast,"" he said. ""The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups.""He added: ""This is a serious business. Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration.""He described as ""absolutely unacceptable"" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters.Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area.""We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians,"" Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of ""still supporting terrorist elements"" in the country.The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees.But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had ""thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups"".The Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison.It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions.Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons.The US said last week that so far only about 4% of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country.US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was ""concerned"" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus ""had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment"".Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March.A deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June.The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is overseeing the destruction operation, has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns.Mr Mekdad stressed: ""Syria is committed to all its agreements, with the OPCW and the UN Security Council.

"The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. ""Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,"" he was once quoted as saying.And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.""Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,"" he said.During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work ""any monkey"" could do.The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.""I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,"" he said of the synthetic microbes.""If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.""","The passage describes the life and work of biologist and entrepreneur Dr. J Craig Venter, who is known for his contributions to the field of human genomics. He was involved in a competitive race to map the human genome, which led to the publication of the human genome in 2001. After this, he turned his attention to creating a synthetic life form, which resulted in the creation of an organism called Synthia. Dr. Venter's work has been met with criticism and controversy, but he has also been praised for his innovative approaches and the potential benefits of his work, such as the creation of synthetic microbes that could help reduce dependence on oil and reverse environmental damage. Dr. Venter's sense of urgency and determination to make scientific breakthroughs stem from his experiences as a medic in the Vietnam War.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.55192,0.9004,0.95426,1,1.0
"Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns.It says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects.The Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to ""drive up standards"".The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved.The study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level.The report cites figures that suggest  apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems.Only 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels.The report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330.The report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work.And it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship.In his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were ""poor"".The attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said.""Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society,"" he said.He said the ""cruel deception"" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop.The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.Sir Peter said: ""Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.""Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice.""England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs.""Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: ""Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do.""The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved.""The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved.""A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.""Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job.""We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month.""","The Sutton Trust has warned that many apprenticeships in England are of low quality and too short, with only 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting each year rated at level three (equivalent to A-level).

"Last weekend, the country was declared free of the virus that killed almost 4,000 people in the country over the past 18 months.He told the BBC's Richard Hamilton about his experiences in the civil war, which ended in 2002, and his Ebola work:I had a normal family life before the war started in 1991.But at 15 I was kidnapped by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and taken to the jungle where I was trained on how to use a gun and initiated into the group.I thought it was the end of my life. It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.They used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.It seems like a nightmare now.I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.If they said: ""We don't have food"", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.Sometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.I lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.Fortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.He encouraged me saying: ""You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.""At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.Through this so many lives were saved.There were three key activities.We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.We educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.Thirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.People were frightened.Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.It was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.We didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.Now I see my life as a changed person.I regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.We are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.If we invest in them then we are building the future.11,314Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)4,808 Liberia3,955 Sierra Leone2,536 Guinea8 Nigeria","The passage describes the experiences of a former child soldier in Sierra Leone, who was kidnapped by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) at the age of 15 and forced to commit violent acts.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, announced a one-year extension to his term, which was originally set to end in 2018, instead of staying until 2021 or leaving as planned. This decision was influenced by personal reasons, as one of his daughters will be finishing her A-levels and another will be completing her GCSEs in 2018, and the family plans to return to Canada at that time. The decision was not due to political pressure or economic predictions, and there is no tension with the Prime Minister, who was keen for Carney to extend his period in office. The extension will allow Carney to oversee the initial stages of Brexit negotiations, with the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU expected to be complete by the end of his extended term.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.72516,0.93321,0.9735,1,1.0

"The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections.It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999.It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time.APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan.The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja.The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo.It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency.However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub.The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east.Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory.Elections were not held in seven states.Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, AbujaThe APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.Why Jonathan lost?Buhari's historic victoryNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.","The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in the recent elections, marking the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military rule ended in 1999.

In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant.In order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition.The film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around.Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will ""help the public understand a little more about autism"".The film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism.The film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube.Alzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia.A Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition.Virtual meatballsVirtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections.In April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive.Gamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, ""not a typical Ikea customer"" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction.""In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action,"" she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London.""And what they wanted was meatball,"" she said.Meatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants.When meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: ""I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it.""""This is really talking to customers,"" said Ms Franov.Now the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look.Healthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias.Surgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital.Some 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour.Now the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately ""democratise medicine"".Meanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders.In one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation.In September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars.The kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK.Most pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they ""were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me"".Marcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills.

The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool,"" he said.At VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning.""One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required,"" he said.Cash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least.","The passage discusses the various applications of Virtual Reality (VR) technology beyond entertainment.

There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet.""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.""The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"".He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""","The passage discusses a review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform in Scotland, which found that the current council tax system has inherent problems.

"It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud.The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented.However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice.One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option.The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before.They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app.If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase.They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out.While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service.That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker.Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's ""forensic"" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad.ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was ""the only one able to do that"".He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used.""I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,"" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account.""The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled.""However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system.""The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,"" he said.""And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back.""Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies.""But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test.""We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.""It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it.""And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too.""Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it ""plans to more aggressively encourage people"" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords.""When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,"" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper.""I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.""","The passage discusses Apple's implementation of a two-step verification system for iCloud to prevent unauthorized access to user data, following the leak of celebrity photos. The system requires users to enter a four-digit code sent to a trusted device in addition to their username and password. This security measure, previously optional, now applies to iCloud back-ups, preventing third-party software like Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker from accessing user data. Vladimir Katalov, the owner of Elcomsoft, acknowledges the security of Apple's new implementation. However, he raises concerns about the recovery key, which could be lost or stolen, potentially leading to data loss or unauthorized access. Professor Alan Woodward suggests that two-factor authentication should be the default setting for all major tech companies, not just Apple.

"Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year's Nations Cup.Morocco, meanwhile, were only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned a ban on its participation.We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco""We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco,"" said Moroccan FA chief Fouzi Lekjaa.""We are back after a little break of a few months, but it has not had a big impact. The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass.""Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000).Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.""I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,"" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.""We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,"" said Snoussi.""But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium.""""But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. ""We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.""In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match.""Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.""Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,"" said Snoussi.""We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.""Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.","The passage discusses the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations and the participation of Tunisia and Morocco.

"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points.This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid.Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentalityThe slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine.Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit.This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history.In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it.But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.","The passage discusses the current struggles of the McLaren Formula One team, which has a rich history of success with 182 grand prix wins, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles.

There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.""The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.""Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.""Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).""The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.""","The passage discusses the suspension of shale gas drilling, also known as ""fracking"", by Cuadrilla in Lancashire, UK, following a 1.5 magnitude tremor, the second in two months.

"carriers of the brca1 gene , like hollywood star angelina jolie , can reduce their risk of death once they have been diagnosed with breast cancer by having their ovaries removed
women diagnosed with breast cancer caused by the gene carried by angelina jolie could be helped to beat the disease if they have their ovaries removed as she did .
a study indicates that following the example of the hollywood star cuts their risk of dying from breast cancer by more than 60 per cent .
miss jolie , 39 , had the procedure , known as an oophorectomy , in march .
two years before , she had a double mastectomy as she carries the brca1 gene variant which dramatically raises the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer .
women who carry a mutated version of brca1 or another gene known as brca2 face a life-time risk of breast cancer of up to 70 per cent .
if diagnosed , they face a severe threat of ovarian tumours .
the researchers in canada analysed 676 breast cancer patients who had one of the mutated genes , nearly half ( 345 ) underwent oophorectomy after their diagnosis .
the study found the 20-year survival rate for the entire group was 77.4 per cent .
having an oophorectomy was associated with a significant drop of 62 per cent in breast cancer death in women with a brca1 mutation , but this did not occur in those with a brca2 mutation .
there were nine deaths from ovarian cancer in the women who did not have oophorectomies .
the scientists found a 65 per cent reduction in death from all causes associated with oophorectomy .
according to the study , oophorectomies were performed an average of six years after breast cancer diagnosis .
for the 70 brca1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years , there was a 73 per cent reduction in death compared with women with the mutation who never underwent the procedure .
the authors , writing in the journal jama oncology , said that the protective effect of oophorectomy against breast cancer was apparent immediately after diagnosis and lasted for 15 years .
dr steven narod , of the women 's college research institute , toronto , called for follow-up studies on women who undergo oophorectomy as part of their initial treatment , in particular , those who had the surgery within a year of finding out they have breast cancer .
he added that more research was needed , especially on carriers of the brca2 variant .
journal editor dr mary disis said the results were ` compelling and suggest the potential of oophorectomy should become part of the treatment discussion at the time of diagnosis for brca mutation carriers with early stage breast cancers ' .
she added : ` the results provide a validation of oophorectomy in coveying both a disease-free and overall survival benefit for brca1 carriers .
` in the entire group , oophorectomy was particularly effective for survival benefit in women with oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer . '
those women diagnosed with the brca1 gene mutation have a 50 to 80 per cent risk of developing breast cancer , pictured , in their lifetime
women with a significant family history of breast cancer may have an increased risk of getting the disease .
a significant family history is defined by :
women who inherit the faulty , or mutated , brca1 or brca2 genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime .
genetic tests are available to women who are likely to have a brca1 or brca2 mutation , or faults in two other genes called tp53 and pten .
brca gene faults are more common in the ashkenazi jewish population , about 2.3 per cent of ashkenazi jewish women have a brca gene mutation .
this type of the disease affects about one in four women diagnosed with breast cancer .
it is an especially aggressive form which is often resilient to drug treatment and requires intensive chemotherapy .
other studies of the gene mutation carriers have found that reduced mortality is associated with ovary removal for women with a history of breast cancer .
speaking about her decision to have the procedure miss jolie , who has six children , said that having her ovaries removed did not make her feel any less womanly .
in an article for the new york times , she wrote : ` i feel feminine , and grounded in the choices i am making for myself and my family .

"an informant who spent the last 27 years working for the dea as an undercover operative in exchange for the promise of us citizenship says he 'll be deported now that he has retired .
carlos toro , 66 , worked as a mid-level member of the medellin cartel in the 1980s when a confrontation with his boss caused him to flee from colombia fearing for his life .
toro came to the united states and eventually began working for the dea as an informant after providing information about a number of his former bosses and associates .
carlos toro , seen in 1982 , is facing deportation from the united states after working for the dea for 27 years
toro , 66 , was one of the dea 's strongest assets and helped carry out undercover stings around the world
carlos lehder rivas of colombia was taken down thanks in part to former medellin cartel member toro
the ex-cartel member became one of the dea 's most important assets and helped the agency carry out undercover stings around the world , cbs news reported .
he was n't paid for work , but was told he would be rewarded with us citizenship .
that has not happened and toro is now technically living in the us illegally after declining health forced him to retire , according to the florida center for investigative reporting .
the dea refused to help toro with his citizenship after he went public with his plight .
he said : ` if i am sent back to colombia , i would be dead within the first four hours . '
` i am scared to death .
i do n't sleep anymore .
` i 'm only thinking about what happens if they come for me .
` the united states government has sentenced me to death . '
information provided by toro aided in the prosecution of ex-panamanian dictator manuel noriega ( seen 1990 )
his fears sound reasonable considering his work aided in the prosecution of cocaine overlord carlos lehder and former panamanian dictator manuel noriega .
dea agent mike mcmanus , who was toro 's handler for two years , gained notoriety after working with the uniquely-suited operative .
mcmanus who arrested george jung - the drug dealer portrayed by johnny depp in 2001 's blow - gave toro $ 5,000 for an operation after the dea declined to help , the huffington post reported .
he said : ` it is government bureaucracy at its worst .
` he deserves to live life ever after in the united states .
he 's done his debt , he 's paid his dues , he 's done his service . '

"a mother of a baby boy was arrested 27 years after his body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a sainsbury 's bag floating on a village pond .
police exhumed the boy 's body from his grave in norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review .
a dna sample eventually led them to his mother .
the woman , who has not been named , was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends .
she explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of weasenham st peter on june 5 , 1988 , just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a sunday afternoon outing .
unsolved case : a police officer searches windmill pit , the norfolk pond where the baby boy 's body was found back in 1988
the boy 's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review , with dna samples leading police to the boy 's mother .
he has now been reburied at weasenham st peter church , norfolk
police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the cps decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial .
during the original investigation , police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby 's burial at 13th century st peter 's church in the village .
a report in the eastern daily press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond
but after the body was exhumed in april last year , dna taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents .
detectives examined that person 's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy 's mother .
a police spokesman said : ` in this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation .
` thanks to advances in dna we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself .
` sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play . '
det insp andy guy , of norfolk police who led the investigation said the dna was compared to five million samples on the national database .
he said : ` it came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age .
` we went to see that individual and she told us she was mum .
she was arrested on suspicion of infanticide .
` we were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her .
` the pregnancy was concealed from everybody .
she did n't tell her family , her close friends , she gave birth in secret .
the baby was stillborn . '
the woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond , known locally as windmill pit , before it was found by a group of teenagers .
the boy was originally buried without a name but a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as peter after the name of the church
a second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play .
an inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death .
the baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on june 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named peter after the name of the church .
det insp guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time .
he added : ` this has been unsolved for 27 years .
by using the latest techniques , we 've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time . '
` we do n't ever give up .
all the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they 're reviewed at regular intervals . '
det insp guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had ` mixed feelings ' after bringing the investigation to a final close .
he said : ` from a police officer 's perspective , it 's fantastic .
from a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her . '
the grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross , which read : ` in loving memory of unknown baby boy .
born and died 1988 . '
a support group called hana 's gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as peter .
the inscription reads : ` in loving memory of baby peter , june 1988 .
a sweet little child , lost but then found , to bloom and grow in heaven 's playground .
there is no foot so small that it can not leave an imprint on the world . '
tranquil : the pond in the village of weasenham st peter , norfolk , as it is today
karen murray-tye who set up hana 's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006 , said : ` it was quite hard to find the right words , but i thought the ` lost but found ' fitted the circumstances .
` i hope she sees we 've tried to do the best for him as we have for hana .
it would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward . '
norfolk coroner 's chaplain chris copsey said : ` when the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said ` unnamed baby boy ' .
` it seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so i took the name of the church , st peter 's church . '

"a taxi driver has been ordered to pay compensation to a passenger who was left with severe brain injuries after he jumped out of the moving car .
kristopher hicks , now 27 , was on his way home from a night out in bath , somerset , with his girlfriend in a taxi driven by michael young , 56 , five years ago .
mr young , a former soldier , had mistakenly believed mr hicks was planning to ` do a runner ' and decided to drive him back to the rank in a bid to teach him a lesson .
but when mr hicks objected , the driver continued on for almost a mile , leading him to jump from the vehicle while it was travelling at more than 20mph .
he suffered devastating brain injuries , developed epilepsy and now requires round-the-clock care from his mother .
mr hicks ' family , from bath , took driver mr young to the high court ( pictured ) , where a judge ruled he had unlawfully imprisoned his passenger
mr hicks ' family , from bath , took mr young to the high court .
there , mr justice edis ruled the driver had unlawfully imprisoned mr hicks , who was therefore entitled to damages .
the exact amount of compensation is yet to be decided - but is set to be around 50 per cent of what the family had requested and thought to be ` hundreds of thousands of pounds ' .
speaking on behalf of the family , lawyer james davies said : ` this was a terrible incident in which kristopher suffered a very severe brain injury leaving him needing care for the rest of his life .
` the latest judgement agrees that kristopher is entitled to a settlement to provide specialist rehabilitation and care which will help maximise his progress . '
mr hicks , who was 23 at the time of the incident , had gotten into the taxi with his girlfriend abigail noad at orange grove taxi rank in bath to his home in the foxhill area , according to high court documents .
in a police interview , mr young said he had become suspicious after hearing ms noad joke that the couple were not going to ` do a runner ' .
deciding the issue of liability , the judge said mr young mistakenly decided mr hicks was not going to pay the fare on november 2 in 2010 , adding there was no basis for him to think so .
the driver had decided to take mr hicks back to the rank to cause him as much inconvenience as possible .
mr hicks , who found himself being unlawfully driven off by a stranger into the night , decided he should try to escape .
mr justice edis said : ` the end result is that the claimant decided to jump out of the taxi at a dangerous speed .
i do not know why he did this .
` it may have been that he misjudged the speed and thought it was safe to do so , but the true motive will never be known . '
he said had mr hicks jumped out when it was stationary at lights there would be no permanent damage .
mr hicks had gotten into the taxi at the orange grove rank in bath ( pictured ) in 2010 with his girlfriend
` i have broadly accepted the evidence of the defendant and therefore find that his intention was not to do anything other than to return him to the rank where he would be released , ' he added .
` this is the kind of conduct which creates a significant risk to life and limb as this case demonstrates . '
the judge said it was a ` stark and unattractive choice ' to decide between the two - and concluded there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the damages payable to mr hicks .
he was also entitled to a further £ 250 for unlawful imprisonment .
lawyers representing mr hicks said the incident left him with ` devastating ' brain injuries and he is now being cared for by his mother gill .
speaking at the time the claim was lodged with the high court , james davies , said : ` whilst he has undergone extensive treatment and rehabilitation , he has developed post-traumatic epilepsy , headaches , fatigue , suffers social and behavioural problems and has no sense of taste or smell .
` he is reliant on 24-hour care from his mum and is unable to work . '
both sides were given permission to appeal and a further hearing will determine the amount which mr young will have to pay .","The passage describes a case where a taxi driver, Michael Young, was ordered to pay compensation to his passenger, Kristopher Hicks, who suffered severe brain injuries after jumping out of the moving taxi.

The driver mistakenly believed Hicks was not going to pay the fare and decided to take him back to the rank. Hicks, feeling threatened, jumped out of the moving vehicle and sustained severe injuries.

the video maker can be heard saying that the plane 's propellers have been damaged in the collision with the runway and that more than likely , the pilot will crash .
he later said : ` i was walking down the flight line of aircraft that flew in for the day , which is close to the main runway and noticed this light twin aircraft coming in low .
` i noticed he did not have his landing gear down and thought he was going to do a fly-by , but then noticed the power was pulled back with the aircraft approaching for a landing with no landing gear .
the plane scratches along the runway and the video maker describes the sound as ` one you will not forget '
` the belly and tips of the propellers impacted the runway ( the sound of the propellers hitting the surface was one sound you will not forget ) .
` once the pilot realized his mistake , he gave what appeared to be full throttle and both propellers pulled the front of the aircraft down with the propellers making a second impact with the runway .
` somehow the engines stayed on and running and the pilot was able to regain control while leaving the airport .
the video maker noted that once the pilot realized his mistake he began re-engaging the engine
he added : ` it 's amazing the aeroplane engines did not get destroyed during the propellers impact and the pilot did not stall during the forced take-off with the high angle of attack and damaged propellers . '

"a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped .
domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra .
in february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence .
but today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn .
sentence dropped : domenico rancadore ( right and left ) fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in italy for his role as a ` man of honour '
although his conviction remains intact , italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed .
the case will still have to be heard by the italian supreme court , according to the crown prosecution service ( cps ) .
rancadore 's solicitor , karen todner said : ` yesterday the italian court of appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of domenico rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence .
` i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings .
` there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . '
ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore .
once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it .
the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court .
domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped
rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 .
although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 .
known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ` mafia association ' .
he was convicted for his role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo .
during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition .
in his judgment , judge riddle said : ` i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . '
before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view .
he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe .
rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted .
before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge
there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case .
extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ` what a waste of time and money .
after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . '
mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ` the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment .
` it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence .
` so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : "" hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request "" .
` courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme .
` it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying .
` had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . '
domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra
asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the ` single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' .
barrister philip marshall qc said : ` yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . '
there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today .
curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway .
one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ` you never know who will move in ' .
she went on : ` he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . '
the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health .

today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn
sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ` they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple .
` they are very quiet .
i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street .
also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ` our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct .
groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ` clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection .
most of the clans are led by a ` boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) .
only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges .
it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than € 10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money .
politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections .
the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy .
` he 's very quiet .
he always has been , even before it all blew up .
they are a very quiet family . '
federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ` when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse .
` that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire .
` it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . '
mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ` useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 .
a cps spokesman said : ` the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court .
` it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome .
` until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . '
the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year .
at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .","The passage describes the case of Domenico Rancadore, a Sicilian mafia member who was set to be extradited to Italy after being convicted in absentia for his role in the Cosa Nostra.

"rory mcilroy believes it is ` unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam .
and the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at augusta national in 2011 was the most important day of his career .
mcilroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus and tiger woods .
rory mcilroy tees off at the arnold palmer invitational golf tournament in orlando on march 19

not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome .
it would just be incredible .

i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . '

i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on .
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . '

mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added .
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much .
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot .
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position .
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out .
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . '

the four men appeared in turn in a courtroom in dartmouth , near halifax , where they were given identical but unusual bail conditions that could see them having to live on a canadian naval base for the next few years .
bail was set at over £ 2,000 for each of them but they also agreed to surrender their passports and live at the nearby stadacona naval base in halifax .
accused : joshua finbow , 23 , a submarine engineer from stockbridge , hampshire , arrives at court today

in a deal agreed with the british government , they will also continue to work for the royal navy and draw their current pay .
it was not clear last night how they will keep themselves occupied thousands of miles from their shipmates and a representative from the british high commission who was in court refused to elaborate .
the four -- joshua finbow , 23 , a submarine engineer , craig stoner , 24 , simon radford , 31 , and darren smalley , 35 -- had been playing for the royal navy ice hockey team in a tournament at the shearwater naval base just east of halifax .
the alleged sexual assault , in which police sources say all four men had sexual intercourse with their victim , took place on april 10 after the sailors had returned to the barracks from a hockey game .
sources say their victim , who is aged in her early 20s and lives in halifax , had accompanied a friend who had been invited to attend the party by local canadian servicemen .
yesterday , all four men -- three of them wearing black royal navy ice hockey team hoodies -- looked relieved to be getting out of custody as they respectfully answered judge john macdougall 's questions .

"a mother whose son suffers an incredibly rare disease , which makes his skin appear scalded , was shocked after a stranger reported her to police for child abuse .
four-year-old rj jackson is one of just 70 people in the world who suffers netherton 's syndrome .
his skin appears red and inflamed , and is often covered in dry skin that appears like scales on his body .
his mother valerie jackson has to regularly cover him in creams to try and prevent his skin drying out .
but while out shopping recently , mrs jackson was suddenly surrounded by armed police , who had been called by a member of the public .
valerie jackson , pictured left with her son rj when he was three months old , was accused of scalding her son after a member of the public mistook his rare skin disease for the signs of abuse .
rj , pictured recently right , suffers netherton 's syndrome , an incredibly rare illness which causes his skin to appear red and scaly
as soon as rj was born , mrs jackson , from las vegas , knew there was something wrong with her son , after noticing a red rash spreading across his tiny chest
they reported fears mrs jackson had been abusing rj .
` it just shows the extent of people 's ignorance , ' mrs jackson , from las vegas , said .
the 35-year-old said she is also subjected to taunts in the street , with other mother 's accusing her of burning rj .
` his skin is bright red and shiny , ' mrs jackson added .
` i put vaseline all over him two to three times a day to keep his skin subtle but he is still sore .
` when he was younger he had to have it over his body every few hours -- even in the night .
` we have n't known sleep for about five years . '
the mother-of-four said her young son is also targeted by bullies - many cruel taunts being made by adults .
` one woman came up to me and thought he was badly burnt , ' she said .
` she said sharply to me , "" excuse me , your child has caught the sun "" .
` i could n't believe it .
but we 're used to the staring and ignorant comments .
` i think he is the most beautiful boy in the world .
` he 's got a cheeky smile and an adorable giggle . '
she said rj has been treated like an outcast because of his illness , a rare congenital skin disease , which makes skin red and scaly .
mrs jackson and her husband , reginald , 40 , have to regularly cover rj 's body with creams to ease his painful symptoms .
but she said , both she and her son face cruel taunts from bullies , most of whom are adults
while out shopping with rj , mrs jackson , pictured left with her son in hospital , was suddenly surrounded by armed police .
a member of the pubic had called officers reporting the 35-year-old for child abuse
` it just shows the extent of people 's ignorance , ' mrs jackson said .
she said her son has been treated as an outcast , having been denied entry to play centres and facing cruel jibes from people in the street
` we were denied entry to an indoor playhouse because of his skin , ' she said .
` we 've had the police called for child abuse .
` we were in walmart in las vegas putting his creams on when we were surrounded by five armed police .
netherton 's syndrome is a rare congenital skin disease - a more extreme form of ichthyosis .
sufferers ' skin appears red and scaly and can also experience hair , infection and allergy problems .
because red skin can be attributed to several diseases , the condition may not be accurately diagnosed until later in a child 's life .
most children with the disease appeared ` scalded ' at birth and are slow to gain weight .
their skin quickly loses heat , water and protein and babies are often kept in incubators on special care baby units as a result .
they are more at risk of infection because of their inflammed skin .
parents are advised to reguarly cleanse and moisturiser their child ` skin , while taking care when holding them .
there is no cure for the condition , but in most infants , the symptoms improve with time .
as they get older , a child 's skin may remain red and scaly , and their skin may be itchy , sensitive or raw , sometimes appearing thicker at the joints .
the condition appears out of the blue where there has been no family history .
but , it is thought to be genetic , and parents can carry the faulty gene responsible .
` their guns were n't drawn .
the officer asked what was going on .
i explained and he apologised .
` but it just shows the extent of people 's ignorance . '
mrs jackson , who is married to rj 's father reginald , 40 , said their son was diagnosed when he was a baby .
` after an emergency caesarean , i knew something was n't right , ' she said .
` as rj was lifted up and i saw him for the first time , i noticed an angry rash on his chest .
` he was rushed to intensive care where the rash seemed to spread before our eyes , his skin becoming even redder and cracking . '
she said her first thought was he was being burnt by the incubator light .
` but he was n't , ' she said .
` no one had any idea what was wrong with him .
` when doctors told me i could take him home two weeks later , i burst into tears .
` i did n't think he was well enough to leave hospital .
his skin was crusty and starting to fall off .
` back home , as he cried and screamed , i felt helpless , and wished there was something i could do .
` he 'd scratch at his skin until it bled , so i put socks on his hands to stop him .
` i searched the internet for answers but i could n't find anything . '
she eventually stumbled upon a facebook group called netherton 's syndrome research group .
it had been set up by a couple in the uk whose child , jack oldacres has the condition .
` each symptom was exactly like rj 's , ' mrs jackson said .
` people from all over the world were sharing stories , swapping tips to help one another .
` i knew this was what he had .
i found out netherton 's was a rare strain of the skin condition ichthyosis , affecting one in 200,000 births in the uk .
mrs jackson was desperate to discover what was wrong with rj , centre on his sister 's lap , and so turned to the internet .
there , she found a facebook group set up by the parents of a little boy with the disease .
` each symptom was exactly like rj 's , ' she said .
` i knew this was what he had '
` reginald and i started slathering rj 's skin in vaseline every three hours , like people on the group suggested .
` we bathed him just twice a week because the hard water dried out his skin too much .
` each time i 'd sit with him in the bath and painstakingly remove all the dead skin . '
but , she said , people are still critical of her .
` i 'm happy to explain what netherton 's is , but most people jump to conclusions before i get the chance , ' she said .
` his brother and sisters are great with him , always helping out and standing up for him .
` just like any other little boy , he loves throwing around a ball and is usually bubbly and happy , until his skin starts to hurt .

the sight of the 24-year-old 's toned figure towering above train platforms has caused a stir among feminists and body image campaigners - a change.org petition calling for the adverts to be pulled has already attracted more than 50,000 signatures .
one of the many protein world posters on the london underground that have been defaced
several of the images have also been defaced by bloggers , angry at the perceived insinuation that only women who look like renee are ready to go to the beach .
the advertising standards authority has also received more than 200 complaints from people saying that the adverts promote an unhealthy body image .
but today , tfl confirmed that it was pulling the posters down , because they had come to the end of the three-week advertising period that protein world had paid for .
the company also said it had taken note of the reaction from customers to the advert and that they would bear it in mind if they received a request to put up posters of a similar nature in future .
the posters are now being removed from the london underground
a tfl spokesperson told mailonline : ` this advertisement will begin to be removed from our network as scheduled from tomorrow .
` we have received one complaint about it and we will be guided by the committee of advertising practice ( cap ) and advertising standards authority ( asa ) if a similar advert were to be submitted again .
` we have zero tolerance towards graffiti on the network and take action to prevent it and remove it . '
the removal of the posters comes as a protest organised against protein world in hyde park on may 2 gathers steam - hundreds of people are expected to attend the rally in central london .
the posters have caused a huge backlash on social media , with thousands of tweets directed at the campaign .
one user called catrin stewartwrite : ` you clearly know what you 're trying to sell with that offensive , unrealistic and sexist advert . '
another called livy christophers said : ` you do n't get to tell women what is offensive .
"" are you beach body ready "" really means "" why do n't you look like this . "" '

online fitness store protein world , who claim that the image is entirely unphotoshopped , have been actively engaging in the furore on social media , strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved tweeters .
` we are a nation of sympathisers for fatties , ' a spokesperson for protein world tweeted to one user after she signed the change.org petition calling for the removal of the advert .
` why make your insecurities our problem ? '
tv presenter susanna reid described the campaign for protein shakes , which features a toned swimwear-clad model alongside the slogan ` are you beach body ready ? '
, as ` anxiety inducing ' during an interview with the fitness brand 's head of global marketing on monday morning .
the good morning britain presenter and her co-host ben shephard grilled richard staveley about the uproar surrounding the poster , which has attracted the wrath of many social media users .
many have been outraged that the advert appears to suggest women can not go on the beach in a bikini unless they look like the slim model in the advert .
` what if my only goal is to be on a beach ? '
, susanna asked richard , adding , ` am i irrational by finding that advert a little bit anxiety inducing ? '
weighing in on the debate : susanna reid revealed she found the controversial protein world advert ` anxiety inducing ' on good morning britain on monday
security threat : staveley revealed police were investigating a bomb threat made to the company
the protein world boss defended the campaign , saying : ` that may be but we are a fitness brand , our own aspirations are to make the nation healthier and ask each one of us to set our sights higher , to be fitter , to be healthier and actually have an inner and outer confidence within ourselves . '
the tv stars also addressed the company 's blunt responses to twitter complaints , including ` why make your insecurities our problem ' and ` grow up ' .
but staveley believes the reaction is justified , saying , ` there is an irrational minority who have decided to interpret it in that way . '
susanna , 44 , retorted : ` do you think everybody who objects to it is irrational ?
am i an irrational extremist ? '
defending protein world : richard staveley , head of global marketing , insisted the company 's advert was n't meant to offend and was targeted at health-conscious individuals looking to get fit in time for summer
the company boss revealed protein world has received ` threats on our head office , physical and violent threats ' .
he added : ` we had a bomb threat ... that 's been reported to the police .
it 's currently being investigated . '
staveley concluded his appearance on the itv show by declaring that it had been a ` fantastic campaign ' for the brand and they wo n't changing their advertising methods in future .
the advertising standards authority ( asa ) said it has received 216 complaints about the advert and is ` carefully assessing ' the complaints to ` establish if there are grounds for further action ' .
sales of protein powder - which can be priced up to £ 45 per kilogram tub - are rocketing in the uk , growing from £ 73m in 2007 to £ 170m in 2012 .
they are expected to reach £ 358m by 2017 , according to the market-analyst euromonitor , as gym-going brits add the stuff to post-workout smoothies and drinks in a bid to build muscle .

feminism is n't an excuse for being fat .

"rail firms came under fire this weekend for planning a series of fare hikes of up to 87 per cent just ten days after the general election - despite the main party leaders pledging to freeze prices .
the prime minister has requested first great western ( fgw ) ` urgently review ' its decision to almost double some fares on the route between london and the cotswolds - which passes through his witney constituency .
mr cameron has promised to freeze fares in real terms for the whole of the next parliament , while labour has also pledged to bring in a ` cap ' on price hikes .
sent letter : prime minister david cameron has written to first great western to request it ` urgently reviews ' plans to increase fares on trains running through his witney constituency
passengers travelling from charlbury , the oxfordshire station nearest to his constituency home , can currently purchase an off-peak return to london costing £ 33.30 .
this allows them to leave at 9.42 am , outside the morning peak , but return on one of the four services that go from london during the evening peak period .
but from may 17 , these customers will be forced to pay £ 62.40 if they want to come home on one of these trains - an 87 per cent increase .
the planned changes have angered mr cameron 's constituents - prompting him to personally intervene .
the prime minister 's spokesman told the sunday times : ` mr cameron has written to first great western and asked them to urgently review their decision . '
train companies have three windows every year in which they can increase ` unregulated ' fares , which make up around half of their total revenue .
unregulated fares can include journeys such as off-peak leisure and advance-purchase tickets .
first great western has insisted the reason for the change is to bring the north cotswolds route in line with its other services .
the firm is also offering some customers a cheaper option in advanced single tickets , potentially allowing them to buy a return for £ 20 if they book ahead .
other sharp price hikes to be introduced include an off-peak first-class single from crewe to northampton on london midlands , which will rise from £ 30 to £ 37 , according to trainsplit.com - a website that provides passengers with cheaper ticket options .
the cost of an anytime return between stafford and liverpool , travelling with virgin , will leap from £ 26.50 to £ 33 - a 24.5 per cent hike .
biggest hike : passengers travelling with the rail firm between london and the cotswolds could face increases of up to 87 per cent come may 17
and an anytime first-class day return on virgin from manchester to stoke will go up 22 per cent - rising from £ 29 to £ 35.30 .
virgin has said the ` vast majority ' of its price hikes affected ` virgin trains-only fares ' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms .
it added : ` our overall fare increase this year on the west coast is just 1.65 per cent , well below the industry average . '
speaking to mark hookham of the sunday times , mike richardson , of trainsplit.com , said : ` passengers might very well be surprised at these fare increases when both the main parties have talked about price freeezes .
hundreds of ` anytime ' and ` off-peak ' returns rose by 40 per cent in january .
its research found rail fare increases on tickets that passengers buy on the day and on rural routes .
defended rise : virgin has said the ` vast majority ' of its price hikes affected ` virgin trains-only fares ' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms","The passage discusses planned fare hikes by rail firms, with some increases as high as 87%, despite promises from political leaders to freeze or cap prices.

former soldier john young , 66 , and his new wife elaine , 54 , were sat in the front room of their home in oldham , greater manchester , when thugs began pelting his front window with stones .
when one brick smashed the glass , mr young went and opened his front door to remonstrate with the attackers only to be struck in his left eye by another brick .
he suffered an open wound to his forehead and a serious injury to his left eye and was taken to hospital .
however , despite undergoing emergency surgery , doctors were unable to save his eyesight meaning he is now blind in one eye .
the retired hgv driver , who formerly served with the royal electrical and mechanical engineers during the irish troubles , said he now ` does n't feel safe in his own home ' following the attack last friday .
he said : ` i have lived here nearly all of my life and never had any problems before and i just do n't understand why these people have targeted us .

the attack occurred just three weeks after the couple , who have no children and who met just 14 months ago , got married .
they were writing thank you cards for the wedding gifts they had received when their home was targeted at around 11 pm on april 18 .

the next minute we knew there was glass shattered all over the hall because a brick had hit the door .
` john opened the door and the man was standing there shouting ` come on , come on ' .
the next minute john is covered in blood .
` i just wish he had never opened the front door .
i had already called 999 and for him to go out was a mistake but it obviously was a natural reaction to what was happening .
` we do n't have any idea why it happened .
we feel like it must have been wrong place , wrong time .
john has never had trouble before and neither of us can understand why these people would do something as low as this .
` i have got a flat in southport so we are moving there now .
i do n't think either of us want to come back after what 's happened .
we are just too scared to live in this neighbourhood . '

he said : ` at this stage , there appears to be no known motive for this attack .
` it might be there is no motive other than the culprits were messing around and for whatever reason thought it would be funny to throw bricks at someone 's house .
the attack occurred just three weeks after mr young married his partner elaine , who he met just 14 months ago .

neuroblastoma commonly occurs in either one of the two adrenal glands in a child 's tummy or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord , in the neck , chest , abdomen or pelvis .
the cancer can spread to tissues beyond the original site , including bone marrow , bone , lymph nodes , liver and skin .
as with most cancers the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown .
a neuroblastoma cancer cell in the brain is pictured under the microscope .
fewer than 100 children in the uk are diagnosed each year with this form of cancer
the symptoms vary depending on where a child 's tumour is .
the first signs can be vague , and include tiredness , a loss of appetite and pain in the bones .
if the tumour is in a child 's tummy , it may be swollen and the child may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine .
where a tumour is growing in a child 's chest , they may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing .
tumours growing in the neck can be visible as a lump , and a child is likely to complain of breathing and swallowing problems .
in cases where a tumour is pressing on the spinal cord , children can experience a weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily .
a variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma .
treatment depends on the age of the child , as well as the size and position of the tumour and whether the disease has spread .
children can have surgery , chemotherapy , as well as antibody treatment and radiotherapy .","The passage describes the story of a five-year-old boy, Harley Renshaw, who was diagnosed with cancer in various parts of his body, including his kidney, neck, lungs, and bones. To help him through his radiotherapy treatment, Harley created a superhero mask, inspired by the Ninja Turtles. The mask not only made him feel stronger but also caught the attention of hospital staff, who allowed him to decorate the protective mask used during his treatment. After his story gained international attention, Harley received a box full of Ninja Turtle presents from the children's TV channel Nickelodeon for Christmas. Recently, doctors gave Harley's parents the incredible news that he is cancer-free, following a year of intensive treatment, which included chemotherapy, an operation to remove a kidney tumor, a stem cell transplant, and radiotherapy. Harley's bravery and resilience have made him the face of Cancer Research UK's Kids & Teens campaign, aiming to raise funds for research into child cancers. Neuroblastoma is a rare and aggressive form of childhood cancer, affecting fewer than 100 children in the UK each year, and it is the second most common solid tumor in childhood.

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 2012 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out .

It specifically focuses on the first two fights between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, which took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the first fight, Duran won by a controversial decision. In the rematch, Leonard used his speed and movement to frustrate Duran, who eventually quit in the eighth round, saying ""No Mas.""

"( cnn ) thinking about presidential candidates ?
apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider .
according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?
as cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : "" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .
in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .
i do n't support a woman being president . ""
"" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , "" rios wrote in a facebook post .
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .
throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .
studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .
if science does n't convince you , just google "" cheating politicians "" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .
rios has taken a lot of flak for her "" biblically "" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .
time magazine declared hillary clinton the "" perfect "" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is "" biologically primed "" to lead .
( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )
believe me , i wish i were .
no wonder jon stewart left "" the daily show "" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .
we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .
and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .
unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .
some people believe women have "" our place "" and that place is not at the table .
they 'll tell your daughter to "" go for it "" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .
in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .
the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as "" geniuses "" and the women as "" nice . ""
the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .
hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .
that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .
the fact is , equality benefits everyone .
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .
it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .
it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .
and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .
our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .
it 's not enough to say to our daughters : "" you can be anything you want to be . ""
what we need to say is : "" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . ""
rios said that if clinton is elected , she is "" moving to canada "" because "" a female should n't be president . ""
apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 2019 .
correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .","The passage discusses a female businesswoman, Cheryl Rios, who believes that Hillary Clinton should not be president because her hormones might make her irrational and lead to unnecessary wars. Rios argues that women should not be president due to their hormones, despite acknowledging equal rights. The article also mentions a Time magazine article that suggests Hillary Clinton is the ""perfect"" age to be president because she is postmenopausal and ""biologically primed"" to lead. The author argues that the real issue limiting women's potential is not biochemistry or ability, but a bias in how women and girls are viewed. The author also mentions a series of studies and statistics that highlight the bias women face in the workplace. The author concludes by stating that equality benefits everyone and that it's not enough to say to our daughters ""you can be anything you want to be,"" but rather ""you can be anything you want to be, despite what some people might think.""",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.70147,0.95119,0.97992,1,1.0

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .

the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .

"it seems an accepted trend that chelsea midfielder cesc fabregas struggles during the second half of the season and the spanish midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country 's 2-0 defeat by holland on tuesday .

` i 'm playing almost every minute of every match ( with chelsea ) and that 's what makes me happy , ' he said this week .
but a long , intense campaign on his return to england is taking its toll on the spaniard .

fabregas was brilliant for chelsea in their big win away at swansea city in january but has struggled since
after his £ 30million transfer to chelsea last summer , fabregas ' former club barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-christmas slump .
` there has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club , ' it read .
` despite glowing starts to each campaign , cesc 's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close .
` from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season . '
and it seems to have rung true on the stats front .
having picked up 15 premier league assists by mid-january , he has just one in five games he has played since , and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015 .
thierry henry 's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form , fabregas is now on track to fall just short .
however , with nine games to play chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against .
fabregas ' former team-mate thierry henry ( right ) holds the record for assists in a premier league season
henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump
when he left barcelona , the club commented on fabregas ' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump
their opponents on saturday , stoke city , as well as queens park rangers , manchester united , arsenal , leicester city and west bromwich albion have all been opened up by fabregas ' passing ability this season , while he scored in chelsea 's 2-0 win over crystal palace in october .
the personal accolade will be important to the midfielder , but more key is the boost it could give to his club .
chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games , and if fabregas finds form again the premier league title could be wrapped up within weeks .
mourinho will hope his assist for diego costa in chelsea 's last game against hull city is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong .

"police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place -- despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker .
last night the victim , mike lane , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ` pathetic ' .
he said : ` they could have made more effort .
i 've been told that unless further evidence comes forward , the attackers are not likely to be found .

attack : mike lane ,40 , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs
a video of the incident and a dossier of evidence , including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers , was given to wiltshire police after the assault .
the attack at everleigh , near amesbury , took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent , rather than a fox .
during the incident , mr lane , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , was sent flying to the ground , before being kicked in the head .
he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .
the face of the thug who kicked mr lane was captured on video .
following the attack , wiltshire police issued the suspect 's photograph , although he has not been identified .
in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr lane said : ` i 've been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence .
it 's angered us because we gave them evidence .
i 'm beginning to lose my trust in the police . '
wiltshire police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country .
this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .

"( cnn ) he was known as the american mouthpiece of al qaeda , speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that 's devoted blood and resources to attacking it .
the white house announced thursday that adam gadahn , 36 , was killed in january in a u.s. government counterterrorism operation .
neither he nor ahmed farouq -- another u.s. citizen and al qaeda operative who died in what the white house said was "" likely a separate "" operation -- was specifically targeted , according to the statement .
warren weinstein , a u.s. citizen who was abducted by al qaeda in pakistan in 2011 , died along with another hostage , italian giovanni lo porto , in the attack that killed farouq , according to the white house .
white house : u.s. hostage killed in strike on al qaeda
while he was n't one of al qaeda 's top leaders , gadahn was one of its most prominent members , given his many statements on behalf of the organization .
also known as azzam the american , he was born in 1978 .
his parents changed their name from pearlman to gadahn after their marriage .
he grew up on a farm in rural california and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents , who were jewish .
he converted to islam in 1995 and left the united states for pakistan three years later .
his father said gadahn last contacted the family in 2002 .
a former al qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting gadahn at peshawar airport in september 1998 .
gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .
cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda .
among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2038 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy .
gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child .

"she might be approaching her 89th birthday but nothing was going to stop the queen from enjoying a ride in the spring sunshine this morning .
the monarch , 88 , was spotted trotting through windsor great park aboard her faithful black fell pony , carltonlima emma .
joined by a groom on another of her fell ponies , the queen cut a relaxed figure as she enjoyed her ride but , as is her wont , eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves .
enjoying the sunshine : the queen enjoys a ride on her fell pony carltonlima emma
the queen , who has never worn riding helmets , has been encouraged to wear the safety hats in the past but is reportedly reluctant to wear one because of her hair .
speaking in an interview last year , her racing trainer ian balding recalled the moment he asked why the monarch never wears a riding hat .
the queen is said to have replied : ` i never have and you do n't have to have your hair done like i do . '
her majesty is famous for her love of horses and first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a shetland pony , named peggy , aged four .
since then , the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds , among them betsy , a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50 's , and surprise , a grey gelding whom the queen famously galloped down the course at ascot in 1961 .
equine enthusiast : her majesty adores the ponies and breeds them at hampton court
no helmet : the queen never wears a riding helmet , preferring instead to ride in a silk headscarf
cutting back : she has ridden less in recent years as a result of a niggling knee injury
long term love : the queen has ridden all her life and continues to breed several breeds of horse and pony
recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over trooping the colour on horseback .
nevertheless , the queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and , according to sources , is a familiar sight at her windsor stables .
she is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies , some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren , notably prince edward 's children , lady louise and james , viscount severn .
along with her thoroughbred race horses , the queen also breeds fell ponies and has a stud specialising in highland ponies at balmoral .
first love : the queen 's first pony was a tiny shetland named peggy who was given to her at the age of four
familiar sight : the queen riding her much-loved horse burmese during trooping the colour
seal of approval : a fell pony foal similar to those being bred by the queen at hampton court
one of the oldest equine breeds on the planet , fell ponies like the queen 's mount carltonlima emma , have roamed the moors of cumbria since the neolithic period .
docile , hardy and thick-set , the majority of fell ponies are black , grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh .
highly prized by the carvetii , the iron age tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago , the ponies later caught the eye of the invading romans and were used as trade goods all over the empire .
the romans also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today .
originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall ( similar to dartmoor and exmoor ponies ) , by the end of the roman period , the average fell was more than a hand higher .
another invader to fall in love with the fell pony was the vikings , who used the animals as pack ponies ; a use continued by the normans .
by the 13th century , the fell 's usefulness as a pack animal was well-established and the pony played an important role in british trade until the end of the 18th century .
following the industrial revolution , fells were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town , as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed .
although previously used in trotting races , the fell pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s , when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families .
today , the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages , among them the queen who breeds fell ponies at her hampton court stud .

"breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic ` markers '
breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic ` markers ' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness .
after surgery , the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened , and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning .
for some women , the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent , which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy .
the majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence .
although the medication kills off cancer cells , the side effects -- including complete hair loss , nausea , sickness , weight gain or loss , and extreme fatigue -- can be difficult to live with .
for some women , the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself .
but experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others , and that for some , chemotherapy may not be necessary .
if the newest of the tests , called endopredict , shows a low score , patients can opt not to have chemotherapy .
most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £ 2,500 , although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the nhs .
surgeon hemant singhal said : ` i think there is a good case for the nhs to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy . '
professor kefah mokbel , consultant breast surgeon at st george 's hospital , london , said : ` with this test we can help patients make an informed choice , whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone . '
becca cornford , a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11 , six and four , was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast .
the majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence
she said : ` i dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy .
i was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children . '
professor mokbel operated on becca in december at the princess grace hospital , london , and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the endopredict .
a low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds .
` i could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return , ' she says .
` there is no treatment that places your chances at zero .
but if you have regular monitoring , there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early . '","The passage discusses the development of new tests that can identify genetic markers in breast cancer tumors, which can help determine the aggressiveness of the cancer and the likelihood of its recurrence. These tests, such as Endopredict, can provide a score that indicates the risk level of cancer recurrence, with a low score suggesting that chemotherapy may not be necessary. This could potentially spare many breast cancer patients from the difficult side effects of chemotherapy.

"tokyo ( cnn ) a bizarre and alarming discovery is raising concerns in japan about the potential for terrorism involving drones .
a drone carrying traces of a radioactive material was found on the rooftop of japan 's equivalent to the white house on wednesday , police and government officials said .
the discovery came on the same day a japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the sendai nuclear power plant in kagoshima prefecture , more than four years after the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster .
prime minister shinzo abe 's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many japanese , who view nuclear energy as too dangerous .
a staff member spotted the drone wednesday morning on the roof of abe 's residence , tokyo metropolitan police said .
dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone , which had four propeller and was 50 centimeters ( 20 inches ) wide .
police say the drone was equipped with a small camera , smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium , a common byproduct of nuclear reactors .
cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed fukushima daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown .
investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle .
the amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans .
chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said the discovery is raising concerns about terrorism .
"" there might be terrorism attempts in the future at the olympics and g7 summit using drones , "" suga said .
"" so we need to examine and review continuously the way small unmanned vehicles like drones should be operated and how to cope with the threat of terrorism from drones .
the government will do all that we can to prevent terrorism . ""
japanese law restricts drone flights around airports to prevent problems with aircraft , but there are no flight restrictions for most of tokyo , including the prime minister 's residence and local and federal government buildings .
abe was not in his office at the time .

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

"doctors are putting the health of women and their babies at risk by performing caesarean sections too readily , un officials warn
doctors are putting the health of women and their babies at risk by performing caesarean sections too readily , un officials warn .
they say the procedure should only be carried out when ` medically necessary ' because it can lead to infections and even death .
just over a quarter of women giving birth in england now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s .
this includes a growing number of women opting to have planned caesareans because they are very anxious about giving birth naturally .
but last night experts from the world health organisation , the un 's public health agency , said this figure should ideally be between just 10 per cent and 15 per cent , due to the dangers and costs involved .
in a statement , they said : ` although it can save lives , caesarean section is often performed without medical need , putting women and their babies at risk of short - and long-term health problems . '
they added that the procedure can lead to ` significant complications , disability or death ' and diverts precious money away from the needs of other patients .
a planned caesarean costs the nhs an average of £ 2,369 , compared to a natural birth at £ 1,665 .
the who statement sharply contradicts current nhs guidelines , which say the procedure should be offered to women even when there is no medical justification .

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight

july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","The passage provides a summary of the historic boxing match between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, which took place on November 25, 1980, in the Louisiana Superdome. Leonard, who had lost the first fight to Duran, used his speed and movement to outmaneuver Duran in the rematch. In the eighth round, Duran turned his back and quit, saying ""No más,"" which shocked the world. Duran's reputation was severely damaged, and it took him three years to restore his status in Panama. Leonard considered forcing Duran to quit as a greater achievement than knocking him out. The two fighters had a third match in 1989, which Leonard won by a landslide.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.69623,0.91213,0.97588,1,1.0

"( cnn ) thinking about presidential candidates ?
apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider .
according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?
as cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : "" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .
in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .
i do n't support a woman being president . ""
"" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , "" rios wrote in a facebook post .
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .
throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .
studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .
if science does n't convince you , just google "" cheating politicians "" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .
rios has taken a lot of flak for her "" biblically "" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .
time magazine declared hillary clinton the "" perfect "" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is "" biologically primed "" to lead .
( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )
believe me , i wish i were .
no wonder jon stewart left "" the daily show "" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .
we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .
and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .
unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .
some people believe women have "" our place "" and that place is not at the table .
they 'll tell your daughter to "" go for it "" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .
in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .
the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as "" geniuses "" and the women as "" nice . ""
the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .
hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .
that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .
the fact is , equality benefits everyone .
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .
it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .
it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .
and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .
our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .
it 's not enough to say to our daughters : "" you can be anything you want to be . ""
what we need to say is : "" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . ""
rios said that if clinton is elected , she is "" moving to canada "" because "" a female should n't be president . ""
apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 1993 .
correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .","The passage discusses a female businesswoman in Texas, Cheryl Rios, who believes that Hillary Clinton should not be president because her hormones might make her irrational and lead to unnecessary wars.

the chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the european champions fell to defeat
after a brilliant start to the season at stamford bridge , the spaniard 's form has dropped off somewhat of late
` i 'm playing almost every minute of every match ( with chelsea ) and that 's what makes me happy , ' he said this week .
but a long , intense campaign on his return to england is taking its toll on the spaniard .
chelsea manager jose mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the amsterdam arena , adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the blues ' title charge decline of late .

jose mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the premier league run-in
diego costa and fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in chelsea 's 3-2 win at hull city
fabregas was brilliant for chelsea in their big win away at swansea city in january but has struggled since
after his £ 30million transfer to chelsea last summer , fabregas ' former club barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-christmas slump .
` there has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club , ' it read .
` despite glowing starts to each campaign , cesc 's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close .
` from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season . '
and it seems to have rung true on the stats front .
having picked up 15 premier league assists by mid-january , he has just one in five games he has played since , and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015 .
thierry henry 's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form , fabregas is now on track to fall just short .
however , with nine games to play chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against .
fabregas ' former team-mate thierry henry ( right ) holds the record for assists in a premier league season
henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump
when he left barcelona , the club commented on fabregas ' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump
their opponents on saturday , stoke city , as well as queens park rangers , manchester united , arsenal , leicester city and west bromwich albion have all been opened up by fabregas ' passing ability this season , while he scored in chelsea 's 2-0 win over crystal palace in october .
the personal accolade will be important to the midfielder , but more key is the boost it could give to his club .
chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games , and if fabregas finds form again the premier league title could be wrapped up within weeks .
mourinho will hope his assist for diego costa in chelsea 's last game against hull city is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong .

"police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place -- despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker .
last night the victim , mike lane , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ` pathetic ' .
he said : ` they could have made more effort .
i 've been told that unless further evidence comes forward , the attackers are not likely to be found .
we find it pathetic . '
attack : mike lane ,40 , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs
a video of the incident and a dossier of evidence , including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers , was given to wiltshire police after the assault .
the attack at everleigh , near amesbury , took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent , rather than a fox .
during the incident , mr lane , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , was sent flying to the ground , before being kicked in the head .
he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .
the face of the thug who kicked mr lane was captured on video .
following the attack , wiltshire police issued the suspect 's photograph , although he has not been identified .
in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr lane said : ` i 've been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence .
it 's angered us because we gave them evidence .
i 'm beginning to lose my trust in the police . '
wiltshire police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country .
this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .
they were looking for trouble -- it was a hardcore element we 'd not seen before .
` they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face .
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth .
i was knocked out for a few minutes .
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar . '
mr lane , who has paid £ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ` i feel let down and think the police could have done more . '
karen fieldsend , 42 , who made the call to police , is furious that the case has been dropped .
` it 's disgraceful , ' she said .
` if you had people assaulted in a city centre , something would be done , but in the countryside people forget about it . '
james cameron , 53 , vice-chairman of the tedworth hunt , added : ` their decision is disappointing , but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings . '
the countryside alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice .
last night a spokesman for wiltshire police said : ` we have been unable to move the inquiry further forward .
at this stage the case has been recorded as undetected , however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened .

"( cnn ) he was known as the american mouthpiece of al qaeda , speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that 's devoted blood and resources to attacking it .
the white house announced thursday that adam gadahn , 36 , was killed in january in a u.s. government counterterrorism operation .
neither he nor ahmed farouq -- another u.s. citizen and al qaeda operative who died in what the white house said was "" likely a separate "" operation -- was specifically targeted , according to the statement .
warren weinstein , a u.s. citizen who was abducted by al qaeda in pakistan in 2011 , died along with another hostage , italian giovanni lo porto , in the attack that killed farouq , according to the white house .
white house : u.s. hostage killed in strike on al qaeda
while he was n't one of al qaeda 's top leaders , gadahn was one of its most prominent members , given his many statements on behalf of the organization .
also known as azzam the american , he was born in 1978 .
his parents changed their name from pearlman to gadahn after their marriage .
he grew up on a farm in rural california and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents , who were jewish .
he converted to islam in 1995 and left the united states for pakistan three years later .
his father said gadahn last contacted the family in 2002 .
a former al qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting gadahn at peshawar airport in september 1998 .
gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .
cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda .
among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2011 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy .
gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child .

jose mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the premier league run-in
diego costa and fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in chelsea 's 3-2 win at hull city
fabregas was brilliant for chelsea in their big win away at swansea city in january but has struggled since
after his £ 30million transfer to chelsea last summer , fabregas ' former club barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-christmas slump .
` there has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club , ' it read .
` despite glowing starts to each campaign , cesc 's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close .
` from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season . '
and it seems to have rung true on the stats front .
having picked up 15 premier league assists by mid-january , he has just one in five games he has played since , and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015 .
thierry henry 's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form , fabregas is now on track to fall just short .
however , with nine games to play chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against .
fabregas ' former team-mate thierry henry ( right ) holds the record for assists in a premier league season
henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump
when he left barcelona , the club commented on fabregas ' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump
their opponents on saturday , stoke city , as well as queens park rangers , manchester united , arsenal , leicester city and west bromwich albion have all been opened up by fabregas ' passing ability this season , while he scored in chelsea 's 2-0 win over crystal palace in october .
the personal accolade will be important to the midfielder , but more key is the boost it could give to his club .
chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games , and if fabregas finds form again the premier league title could be wrapped up within weeks .
mourinho will hope his assist for diego costa in chelsea 's last game against hull city is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong .
fabregas laid on an assist for costa in chelsea 's 3-6 win over hull city , but that was his first in five games
mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the premier league title race , with fabregas a key cog","The passage discusses the recent poor form of Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas, particularly during the second half of the season. Fabregas, who captains the Spanish national team, had a strong start to the season but has seen a decline in his performance in recent matches. This has raised concerns about his durability, despite his happiness at Chelsea. The 27-year-old midfielder has struggled to make an impact in recent games, including Spain's 2-0 defeat to Holland. His form has dipped significantly since October, with his assists in the Premier League dropping from 15 by mid-January to just one in the five games he has played since. Despite this, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will be hoping for a resurgence in Fabregas' form as the team aims to win the Premier League title.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.57225,0.96693,0.56655,1,1.0
"police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place -- despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker .
last night the victim , mike lane , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ` pathetic ' .
he said : ` they could have made more effort .
i 've been told that unless further evidence comes forward , the attackers are not likely to be found .
we find it pathetic . '
attack : mike lane ,40 , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs
a video of the incident and a dossier of evidence , including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers , was given to wiltshire police after the assault .
the attack at everleigh , near amesbury , took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent , rather than a fox .
during the incident , mr lane , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , was sent flying to the ground , before being kicked in the head .
he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .
the face of the thug who kicked mr lane was captured on video .
following the attack , wiltshire police issued the suspect 's photograph , although he has not been identified .
in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr lane said : ` i 've been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence .
it 's angered us because we gave them evidence .
i 'm beginning to lose my trust in the police . '
wiltshire police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country .
this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .
they were looking for trouble -- it was a hardcore element we 'd not seen before .
` they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face .
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth .
i was knocked out for a few minutes .
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar . '
mr lane , who has paid £ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ` i feel let down and think the police could have done more . '
karen fieldsend , 42 , who made the call to police , is furious that the case has been dropped .
` it 's disgraceful , ' she said .
` if you had people assaulted in a city centre , something would be done , but in the countryside people forget about it . '
james cameron , 55 , vice-chairman of the tedworth hunt , added : ` their decision is disappointing , but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings . '
the countryside alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice .
last night a spokesman for wiltshire police said : ` we have been unable to move the inquiry further forward .
at this stage the case has been recorded as undetected , however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened .

"( cnn ) he was known as the american mouthpiece of al qaeda , speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that 's devoted blood and resources to attacking it .
the white house announced thursday that adam gadahn , 36 , was killed in january in a u.s. government counterterrorism operation .
neither he nor ahmed farouq -- another u.s. citizen and al qaeda operative who died in what the white house said was "" likely a separate "" operation -- was specifically targeted , according to the statement .
warren weinstein , a u.s. citizen who was abducted by al qaeda in pakistan in 2011 , died along with another hostage , italian giovanni lo porto , in the attack that killed farouq , according to the white house .
white house : u.s. hostage killed in strike on al qaeda
while he was n't one of al qaeda 's top leaders , gadahn was one of its most prominent members , given his many statements on behalf of the organization .
also known as azzam the american , he was born in 1978 .
his parents changed their name from pearlman to gadahn after their marriage .
he grew up on a farm in rural california and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents , who were jewish .
he converted to islam in 1995 and left the united states for pakistan three years later .
his father said gadahn last contacted the family in 2002 .
a former al qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting gadahn at peshawar airport in september 1998 .
gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .
cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda .
among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2016 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy .
gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child .
cnn 's steve almasy contributed to this report .","The passage discusses the death of American-born al-Qaeda member, Adam Gadahn, in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation in January.

a leading member of the notorious paedophile information exchange , which campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s , has joined the supporters of the media pressure group hacked off .
tom o'carroll , a former open university information officer and formerly a key activist for pie , attended a hacked off rally in the houses of parliament on february 25 to lobby mps for state involvement in media regulation .
the organisation , set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal , is campaigning against what it sees as the ` biased and unfair ' independent press standards organisation .
it wants mps to set up a statutory body to regulate the press , as recommended by the leveson inquiry .
the news that o'carroll is a backer of hacked off will be an embarrassment to the group .
pie was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the national council for civil liberties ( nccl ) .
the nccl lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child ` understood the nature of the act ' and apparently consented .
the group also wanted incest to be legalised .
o'carroll was on the nccl 's gay rights sub-committee .
the 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ` corrupting public morals ' .
he wrote a blog after the february meeting , chaired by comedian john cleese , confirming his attendance .
a hacked off spokesman said that the meeting was ` open to and free for all members of the public to attend ' .

"( cnn ) thinking about presidential candidates ?
apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider .
according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?
as cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : "" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .
in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .
i do n't support a woman being president . ""
"" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , "" rios wrote in a facebook post .
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .
throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .
studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .
if science does n't convince you , just google "" cheating politicians "" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .
rios has taken a lot of flak for her "" biblically "" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .
time magazine declared hillary clinton the "" perfect "" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is "" biologically primed "" to lead .
( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )
believe me , i wish i were .
no wonder jon stewart left "" the daily show "" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .
we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .
and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .
unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .
some people believe women have "" our place "" and that place is not at the table .
they 'll tell your daughter to "" go for it "" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .
in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .
the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as "" geniuses "" and the women as "" nice . ""
the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .
hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .
that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .
the fact is , equality benefits everyone .
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .
it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .
it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .
and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .
our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .
it 's not enough to say to our daughters : "" you can be anything you want to be . ""
what we need to say is : "" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . ""
rios said that if clinton is elected , she is "" moving to canada "" because "" a female should n't be president . ""
apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 2001 .
correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .","The passage discusses a female businesswoman in Texas, Cheryl Rios, who believes that Hillary Clinton should not be president because her hormones might make her irrational and lead to unnecessary wars.

leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 58 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him .

"it seems an accepted trend that chelsea midfielder cesc fabregas struggles during the second half of the season and the spanish midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country 's 2-0 defeat by holland on tuesday .
the 27-year-old spoke of his happiness in south west london earlier this week but his form has significantly dipped from that of the player who , around christmas , looked a dead-cert to break the barclays premier league record for assists .
on tuesday - his first international appearance since october - he was given just four out of 10 by one spanish newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the premier league title following a capital one cup win , questions remain about fabregas ' durability .
cesc fabregas ( right ) captained spain on tuesday but his poor form continued as they lost 2-0 in holland
the chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the european champions fell to defeat
after a brilliant start to the season at stamford bridge , the spaniard 's form has dropped off somewhat of late
` i 'm playing almost every minute of every match ( with chelsea ) and that 's what makes me happy , ' he said this week .
but a long , intense campaign on his return to england is taking its toll on the spaniard .
chelsea manager jose mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the amsterdam arena , adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the blues ' title charge decline of late .
fabregas captained the european champions in the dutch capital but struggled to make any real impact against manchester united 's daley blind or goalscorer davy klaassen .
jose mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the premier league run-in
diego costa and fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in chelsea 's 3-2 win at hull city
fabregas was brilliant for chelsea in their big win away at swansea city in january but has struggled since
after his £ 30million transfer to chelsea last summer , fabregas ' former club barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-christmas slump .
` there has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club , ' it read .
` despite glowing starts to each campaign , cesc 's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close .
` from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season . '
and it seems to have rung true on the stats front .
having picked up 15 premier league assists by mid-january , he has just one in five games he has played since , and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015 .
thierry henry 's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form , fabregas is now on track to fall just short .
however , with nine games to play chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against .
fabregas ' former team-mate thierry henry ( right ) holds the record for assists in a premier league season
henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump
when he left barcelona , the club commented on fabregas ' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump
their opponents on saturday , stoke city , as well as queens park rangers , manchester united , arsenal , leicester city and west bromwich albion have all been opened up by fabregas ' passing ability this season , while he scored in chelsea 's 2-0 win over crystal palace in october .
the personal accolade will be important to the midfielder , but more key is the boost it could give to his club .
chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games , and if fabregas finds form again the premier league title could be wrapped up within weeks .
mourinho will hope his assist for diego costa in chelsea 's last game against hull city is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong .
fabregas laid on an assist for costa in chelsea 's 3-13 win over hull city , but that was his first in five games
mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the premier league title race , with fabregas a key cog","The passage discusses the recent poor form of Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas, particularly in the second half of the season. Fabregas, who captains the Spanish national team, had a strong start to the season but has seen a decline in his performance in recent matches. This has raised concerns about his durability, despite his happiness at Chelsea. The 27-year-old midfielder has struggled to make an impact in recent games, including Spain's 2-0 defeat to Holland. His dip in form is evident in his stats, with only one assist in his last five games, compared to 15 in the first half of the season.

"police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place -- despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker .
last night the victim , mike lane , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ` pathetic ' .
he said : ` they could have made more effort .
i 've been told that unless further evidence comes forward , the attackers are not likely to be found .
we find it pathetic . '
attack : mike lane ,40 , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs
a video of the incident and a dossier of evidence , including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers , was given to wiltshire police after the assault .
the attack at everleigh , near amesbury , took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent , rather than a fox .
during the incident , mr lane , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , was sent flying to the ground , before being kicked in the head .
he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .
the face of the thug who kicked mr lane was captured on video .
following the attack , wiltshire police issued the suspect 's photograph , although he has not been identified .
in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr lane said : ` i 've been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence .
it 's angered us because we gave them evidence .
i 'm beginning to lose my trust in the police . '
wiltshire police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country .
this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .
they were looking for trouble -- it was a hardcore element we 'd not seen before .
` they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face .
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth .
i was knocked out for a few minutes .
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar . '
mr lane , who has paid £ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ` i feel let down and think the police could have done more . '
karen fieldsend , 42 , who made the call to police , is furious that the case has been dropped .
` it 's disgraceful , ' she said .
` if you had people assaulted in a city centre , something would be done , but in the countryside people forget about it . '
james cameron , 58 , vice-chairman of the tedworth hunt , added : ` their decision is disappointing , but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings . '
the countryside alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice .
last night a spokesman for wiltshire police said : ` we have been unable to move the inquiry further forward .
at this stage the case has been recorded as undetected , however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened .

"( cnn ) he was known as the american mouthpiece of al qaeda , speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that 's devoted blood and resources to attacking it .
the white house announced thursday that adam gadahn , 36 , was killed in january in a u.s. government counterterrorism operation .
neither he nor ahmed farouq -- another u.s. citizen and al qaeda operative who died in what the white house said was "" likely a separate "" operation -- was specifically targeted , according to the statement .
warren weinstein , a u.s. citizen who was abducted by al qaeda in pakistan in 2011 , died along with another hostage , italian giovanni lo porto , in the attack that killed farouq , according to the white house .
white house : u.s. hostage killed in strike on al qaeda
while he was n't one of al qaeda 's top leaders , gadahn was one of its most prominent members , given his many statements on behalf of the organization .
also known as azzam the american , he was born in 1978 .
his parents changed their name from pearlman to gadahn after their marriage .
he grew up on a farm in rural california and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents , who were jewish .
he converted to islam in 1995 and left the united states for pakistan three years later .
his father said gadahn last contacted the family in 2002 .
a former al qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting gadahn at peshawar airport in september 1998 .
gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .
cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda .
among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2021 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy .
gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child .

"( cnn ) thinking about presidential candidates ?
apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider .
according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?
as cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : "" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .
in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .
i do n't support a woman being president . ""
"" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , "" rios wrote in a facebook post .
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .
throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .
studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .
if science does n't convince you , just google "" cheating politicians "" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .
rios has taken a lot of flak for her "" biblically "" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .
time magazine declared hillary clinton the "" perfect "" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is "" biologically primed "" to lead .
( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )
believe me , i wish i were .
no wonder jon stewart left "" the daily show "" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .
we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .
and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .
unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .
some people believe women have "" our place "" and that place is not at the table .
they 'll tell your daughter to "" go for it "" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .
in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .
the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as "" geniuses "" and the women as "" nice . ""
the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .
hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .
that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .
the fact is , equality benefits everyone .
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .
it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .
it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .
and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .
our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .
it 's not enough to say to our daughters : "" you can be anything you want to be . ""
what we need to say is : "" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . ""
rios said that if clinton is elected , she is "" moving to canada "" because "" a female should n't be president . ""
apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 2004 .

gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .
cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda .
among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2027 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy .
gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child .
cnn 's steve almasy contributed to this report .","The passage discusses the death of American-born al-Qaeda member Adam Gadahn, who was killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation in January. Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, was a prominent figure in al-Qaeda, serving as its English-language propagandist. He was indicted in 2006 for treason and material support to al-Qaeda. The White House also announced the death of another U.S. citizen and al-Qaeda operative, Ahmed Farouq, in a separate operation. The passage also mentions the death of Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen abducted by al-Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, in the operation that killed Farouq.

"tony abbott may have thrilled players at an australian rules function by skolling a beer but he’s drawn the ire of anti-drinking campaigners who claim he’s glorifying binge drinking and associating being a man with drinking booze . julie robert , a cultural studies professor at the university of technology sydney , said it was ' problematic ' that the prime minister , who she believes should be advocating against binge drinking , thought it acceptable to ' showcase his masculinity ' by skolling a beer . ‘ it sets up a culture that drinking isn’t about socialising with friends , it’s about how quickly and how much you can drink , ’ she said . scroll down for video . australian prime minister tony abbott was cheered on by a crowd of about 50 as he skolled a schooner of beer . mr abbott came under fire after the incident as anti-drinking campaigners said he was glorifying binge drinking . ‘ it sets up a culture that drinking isn’t about socialising with friends , it’s about how quickly and how much you can drink . ’ on saturday night mr abbott appeared happy to oblige when he was asked to have a drink by university of technology sydney bats coach simon carradous . it took the prime minister about six seconds to down the schooner as players cheered and chanted ' skol ' and ' tony ' . dr robert warned people can forget their limits when they are wrapped up in the act of demonstrating how much , or how quickly , they can drink .

They argued that this behavior could encourage unhealthy drinking habits and make it harder to promote responsible drinking.

"indiana has seen a ' significant increase ' in the number of cases of hiv more than two weeks into a short-term needle exchange program approved by gov . mike pence , state health officials said on friday . there are now 120 confirmed hiv cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to scott county , about 30 miles north of louisville , kentucky . that 's up from 106 last week , said the indiana state department of health . health officials who declared an epidemic last month have said they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested . but the growing number could put pressure on pence to extend the 30-day needle exchange program that he approved on march 26 . scroll down for video . more than two weeks into a short-term needle exchange program approved by gov . mike pence , there are now 120 confirmed hiv cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to scott county , about 30 miles north of louisville , kentucky . spokeswoman kara brooks said pence is reviewing reports and recommendations from health officials and will make a decision early next week about extending the program beyond april 25 . the scott county outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered painkiller opana , health officials have said . the county typically sees about five hiv cases each year . since pence approved the temporary needle exchange , 5,322 clean syringes have been provided to 86 participants , health officials said friday . about 1,400 used syringes have been returned . brittany combs , public health nurse for the scott county health department , said the needle-exchange program had ' really picked up a lot this week , ' in large part because a mobile unit has been traveling around neighborhoods seeking to get more iv drug users into the program . ' it 's that trust factor . you have to gain that trust , and i think we 're slowly starting to do that , ' combs said . but the future of the scott county program , as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle-exchange programs in other counties , is n't clear . the scott county outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered prescription painkiller opana , health officials have said . pence opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy . senate president pro tem david long said on thursday that the emergency exchange for scott county was ' the right reaction ' but was n't sure if it is the correct approach long-term . nor was he sure whether the senate would support legislation sponsored by house public health committee chairman ed clere , r-new albany , that would allow the 23 indiana counties with the highest rate-per-population of hepatitis c to establish their own needle-exchange programs . the centers for disease control and prevention reports that between 50 percent and 90 percent of people with hepatitis c are also infected with hiv . health officials say because of this , high rates of hepatitis c are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential hiv outbreak . the house approved the bill on april 7 in a 54-39 vote , and the measure is scheduled for a hearing on monday in a house-senate conference committee , which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the legislature 's april 29 adjournment deadline . long said pence is n't alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote drug use instead of prevent it .

' he said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people , including lawmakers , uncomfortable . but he thinks the exchange program should n't be viewed as anti-drug policy , but as ' a proven and effective harm-reduction policy . ' ' we simply ca n't afford to view this as a short-term problem , ' clere said . money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options . since 1989 , the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs . pence 's executive order did n't include money for the scott county program . ' they asked the state agencies to find their own money . how sustainable is that ? ' said dr. beth meyerson , co-director of the rural center for aids/std prevention at indiana university . ' there 's no evidence that the pence administration is thinking about this in the long term at all . ' ","The state of Indiana has experienced a significant increase in HIV cases, with 120 confirmed and 10 preliminary positive cases linked to Scott County, a rise from 106 cases the previous week.

Governor Mike Pence approved a 30-day needle exchange program on March 26, which has since distributed 5,322 clean syringes to 86 participants, with 1,400 used syringes returned.

"as healer mangu ram rests with a threadbare blanket over his creaking knees , the 82-year-old looks to the future . it is almost 70 years since he fled the violence that followed the partition of india , and he is still regarded as a second class citizen in indian kashmir – unable to own property or vote in state elections . but now ram and thousands like him are daring to hope they will finally be able to shed the refugee status that has plagued them for decades , after prime minister narendra modi 's hindu nationalist party won a share of power in india 's only muslim-majority state . mangu ram was 14 when he fled to kashmir as a refugee - now an old man , for the past 70 years he has been denied citizenship rights . a hindu , traditional healer ram lives a slum house within india 's only muslim-majority state . its rulers have refused to give the west pakistan refugees ( wprs ) the right to own property or vote in state elections -

despite most of them never visiting pakistan , and living in the jammu region of india . most of those refugees were quickly absorbed in towns and cities of the newly-independent nations . however the fate of the west pakistan refugees ( wprs ) like ram who decamped to jammu and kashmir state became mired in the dispute with pakistan over the territory . because of this , its rulers held off granting the refugees residential rights , including the right to buy land , vote in state polls or work in the state government.. . observers say the reluctance of successive state governments to grant full rights to the overwhelmingly hindu wprs stems from fears of upsetting the demographic balance in india 's only muslim-majority state , which has special autonomy enshrined in the constitution . a hindu refugee washes pots at a communal hand pump in surej chak , on the outskirts of jammu . the area has evolved into one of the many slum settlements in hind-dominated areas of the city region of jammu , within india 's only muslim-majority state . generations of families have become stuck in poverty because of their continuing refugee status . successive governments have failed to act to due , say commentators , to a fear of upsetting the demographic balance of the state between the muslim and hindu populations . the wprs , whose families mainly originate from punjab , have fallen foul of a pre-independence law that only grants citizenship to people born - or descendants of those born - in the old undivided kingdom of kashmir . the same legislation has allowed around 35,000 hindus who have fled pakistan-controlled kashmir since partition to be granted citizenship . there are around 100,000 people classified as wprs , most living in the jammu region . hardly any of them have ever set foot in pakistan . a hindu refugee widow , who receives a monthly pension of £2 , walks in surej chak . the community live in poverty , while kashmir is one of india 's more prosperous states . activist labha ram gandhi said : ' granting us state-subject rights is the only way to improve our condition ' . with a hindu nationalist party winning a share of power in kashmir , there is hope . bharatiya janata party are expected to champion the refugees ' cause . but a veteran activist labha ram ghandi warned the community is not afraid to take matters into their own hands . suspected rebels shot dead three unarmed policemen monday in the disputed himalayan region of kashmir . the three policemen were investigating a dispute between neighbours when they were fired on by at least three militants wearing army uniforms , officials said . in a separate attack , another officer was critically wounded after suspected militants shot at him inside a bus near northern pattan town , police said . no rebel group immediately claimed responsibility for either attack . kashmir has been in conflict for decades , with rebels fighting either for independence or a merger with neighboring pakistan , which also claims the territory in its entirety while administering part of it . source : associated press . and despite prevailing unrest from different factions , who either fight for independence or to merge once again with pakistan , kashmir is one of india 's more prosperous states . yet the estimated 18,000 wpr families however live in abject poverty , mostly marrying among themselves because of their low economic status . ' i spend whatever money i earn to send my children to school , '' said ramesh kumar , a part-time driver who lives with his wife , two children and mother in a two-room hovel . he says he thinks the law is ‘ridiculous’ , adding : ‘ i was born here ( in india ) . my roots are here . what else do i and my children need to be citizens of this place ? ’ as things stand , kumar 's children can not be admitted to state-run training colleges or be employed in the state government , although they can work for the federal one . but the tide may soon turn on the rights given to refugees , after a pledge by the newly-elected bharatiya janata party to normalise the wprs ' status . although the bjp came second in the december hustings , they have joined a kashmir governing coalition for the first time and are expected to champion the wprs ' cause . ' we have been living here like this for three generations now , ' said veteran activist labha ram gandhi . ' granting us state-subject rights is the only way to improve our condition . ' but he warned the community is ready to take matters into their own hands if their hopes are dashed again . ‘ we will spill our blood on the streets for our rights , ’ he says . the daughter of a hindu refugee studies in her slum home in surej chak . under the current laws she is not allowed to enrolled at a state-run training college or be employed by the state government . such laws , argue opponents , make these families ' second class citizens ' .","The passage describes the situation of 82-year-old Mangu Ram, a Hindu refugee who fled to Indian Kashmir during the partition of India and has been denied citizenship rights for the past 70 years.

' it could also be placed in certain locations at music festivals , organised protests , football matches and other events where having large numbers of people can crash networks . greenstone is still under development and only currently works with firechat at a range of around 20ft ( 6 metres ) . messages sit on greenstone until another firechat comes within range , and the device has a one-year battery life . it can additionally hold up to 1,000 of the most recent messages . open garden is now working with manufacturers to design and sell greenstone and the timeframe will depend on these partnerships .","The passage describes Open Garden's development of a device called Greenstone, which is designed to strengthen off-the-grid networks. Open Garden had previously created the Firechat app, which allows users to chat without the need for internet or mobile signal by utilizing wireless mesh networks.

"a burlesque performer is attempting to eradicate all negativity surrounding the word ' fat ' – by embracing it as an honest , body-positive description of her own physique . during a recent ted talk , lillian bustle , from new jersey , revealed that she also calls herself ' short ' , because she is 5'3 '' , and ' wife ' , because she is married , noting that each of these words is just an honest description of what she is . and ' fat ' is just another self-descriptor for her , who insists that the word does n't have to be used as a synonym for ' ugly ' .

'i’ve never been so happy in all my life , ' she wrote for xojane . 'i’ve had this stupid grin on my face for a week straight . ' besides a few ' trolls ' posting vicious negative comments , lillian received a slew of positive messages , including letters of thanks , personal stories , and an email from a teenage girl who watched the video with her younger sister and said it made them reevaluate the way they viewed their bodies .

She argues that 'fat' should not be synonymous with 'ugly'. Lillian's views are not universally accepted, as size discrimination in the workplace has increased by 66% in the past 30 years. However, she believes that exposure to diverse body types can lead to greater acceptance. Lillian, who weighs 240lbs, uses burlesque as a platform to challenge societal norms and promote body positivity.

"the family of the seven-year-old british boy killed in the french alps say his death has left a ` vast void in their hearts ' .
carwyn scott-howell was described as a ` daring , outgoing and determined ' youngster whose ` handsome smile lit up any room ' .
the schoolboy was skiing with his family when he became separated from his mother and headed into dense woodland where he fell over a 164ft drop .
tragedy : carwyn scott-howell ( left ; right ) fell to his death while on holiday with his mother ceri , nine-year-old sister antonia and brother gerwyn , 19 , in the alps
footprints in the snow eventually led police to his body , investigators revealed last night .
they also described how the boy 's mother cari , 44 , desperately tried to find her missing son .
in a moving tribute , carwyn 's family described how he ` made life full of laughter with never a dull moment ' .
` seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky , ' they added .
` carwyn was an adorable , caring person who gave so much love .
the family can not explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts . '
carwyn , from talybont-on-usk in wales , was said to have been a ` very competent skier and snowboarder ' who had started skiing at the age of three .
the family said they had spent ` the most happy ski holiday together ' in the resort of flaine in the days before the tragedy stuck .
they were enjoying their last run of the day when the boy 's sister antonia , nine , lost her ski on a jump and carwyn pressed on ahead .
his mother stopped to help her daughter and continued to the bottom of the piste .
but carwyn -- who modelled himself on the tv adventurer bear grylls -- was nowhere to be seen .
mrs scott-howell returned to their hotel believing her son had made his own way back , but returned to the mountain when she found he was n't there .
pierre-yves michau , the judge heading the investigation , said yesterday : ` she asked everyone if they had seen him . '
it is believed carwyn left the piste and entered woodland because he had spotted the resort through the trees .
taking off his skis , he continued on foot as he hurried to get there .
police chief michel ollagnon confirmed that officers had been led to the boy 's body by footprints in the snow .
he said the final steps were broken up by ` sliding marks ' where carwyn had tackled the sharper inclines on his backside .

police last night said carwyn 's body is ready to be repatriated but his family remained in the alps .
back in wales , his friends have written in a condolence book on display at brecon cathedral : ` miss you in class .
we will miss you always . '
alongside the book is a picture of carwyn dressed in his karate kit .
at the youngster 's school in brecon , head teacher emyr jones said pupils were devastated , adding : ` we are all grieving . '

"just 13 and in the grip of a terrifying obsession surviving on just one piece of fruit a day , anorexic schoolgirl laura scurr 's body started to shut down .
the 15-year-old , from whitley bay , was left on a heart machine after she collapsed through starvation but has now spoken about pressures put on teenagers to be a ` size zero ' .
laura became so obsessed with having the perfect figure she would hide food down the side of her bed , lying to her mother about eating and sometimes surviving on just a piece of fruit a day .
laura scurr , 15 , has spoken out about the pressures on young girls to be a size zero after , having becoming obsessed with her own weight , she developed anorexia
but her dramatic weight loss led to horrific consequences when she suddenly collapsed at her family home and was rushed to intensive care .
laura has spoken about her two-year fight with anorexia and revealed the pressures she felt to be thin .
she said : ` at the worst point i was hiding food down the sides of the settee or beds , lying to my mum about having meals , and eating about 100 calories a day .
` i would even try to have mashed potato with each meal so i could hide the rest of the food under it , that way it looked like i 'd ate more . '
after spending a week on a heart monitor at north tyneside general hospital , laura was finally offered support from eating disorder organisations as she began her recovery .
problems started for the teen two years ago when she decided she wanted to go on a diet .
` i was nearly 13 stone and felt like i was too big , ' laura said .
` i 'd been bullied a little bit because of my weight , people saying things like ` here comes the whale ' and that made me feel horrible .
laura was living off just one piece of fruit a day and would hide her food down the side of her bed so her parents would n't see it
laura continued : ` i would look around at the other girls and they all seemed to be skinny and , of course , i wanted to be like them and fit into all the different types of clothes .
` but it was n't just people i knew .
i felt there was a lot of pressures from all over the place .
everywhere you looked there seemed to be this idea that girls should be a size zero . '
laura agreed with mum sue , 48 , to go on a ` sensible diet ' but soon the whitley bay high school pupil became frustrated , wanting to lose more weight , quicker .
according to the nhs anorexia or anorexia nervosa , to give its full name , is a serious mental health condition in which people try to keep their body weight as low as possible .
it is often said that people will often restrict their intake of food , make themselves vomit or increase the amount of exercise they are doing .
the condition often develops in people who are anxious about their body shape or weight , or in those who fear being fat or wish to be thin .
anorexia most commonly occurs in women , starting around the age of 16 or 17 .
although there are cases of men suffering from the disease too .
often people suffering from anorexia will obsessively count calories , take laxatives and repeatedly weight themselves or check their bodies in the mirror .
if you think you know someone who is suffering from the disease talk to them gently about it .
often it can be hard for them to seek help .
you can also seek advice from an eating disorder charity such as beat , who will be able to talk you through how to help them and how to handle the situation .
in february 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the uk - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia .
` it was coming off quite slowly , at about 2 lbs a week , ' said laura .
` but i became much more obsessive about it and decided to reduce my calorie intake .
` in the end , i was virtually eating nothing , maybe an apple or orange a day .
` i could tell my parents were getting worried , they could n't understand why i did n't want to eat . '
lack of food soon took its toll on laura 's health and her heart rate started slowing .
she said : ` i was in bed for three or four days , never going out of the house .
` i would feel dizzy or pass out because my heart rate was so slow . '
finally after a week of eating virtually nothing , laura collapsed .
no happy and healthy laura has made it to the semi final of miss teen gb , the competition aims to stay away from size zero stereotypes
sue , who works in sales , said : ` an ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital and put on the heart monitor for a week .
her body had just started to shut down .
` it was frightening , i was shocked that this was happening to my daughter .
` i remember sitting by her hospital bed and saying "" laura , do you realise how sick you are ? ""
but she just said "" i do n't care , as long as i 'm skinny "" .
` it was then i realised just how much pressure she , and all girls , were under to look a certain way . '
after getting discharged laura began working with eating disorder teams ( edict ) and child and adolescent mental health services ( camhs ) to help in her recovery .
today , her body image is better than ever and her new-found confidence has allowed her to make it through to the semi final of miss teen gb .
the contest aims to promote ` positive and confidence-building experiences ' for young girls , away from size zero stereotypes .","15-year-old Laura Scurr, from Whitley Bay, developed anorexia after becoming obsessed with having the perfect figure.

it is the first in a series of maps of the cosmos that will eventually allow a 3d view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky .
and the map should allow astronomers to study how galaxies formed in the universe .
university of manchester researchers have revealed an hd dark matter map ( shown ) .
it shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4 per cent of the sky .
the goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years .
red here shows more dark matter , and blue shows less .
the moon is shown top left for scale
a team from the university of manchester , led by dr sarah bridle , has spent the past two years measuring the shapes of galaxies used to construct the map .
and the map was released today at the april meeting of the american physical society in baltimore , maryland .
it was created using data captured by the dark energy camera , a 570-megapixel imaging device that is the primary instrument for the dark energy survey ( des ) led by fermilab in the us .
the survey uses the 13ft ( four metres ) victor m. blanco telescope located at the cerro tololo inter-american observatory ( ctio ) in chile .
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery .
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces .
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force .
called ` dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe .
and the project is run overall as part of the five-year dark energy survey ( des ) , and is the largest map of this detail .
of course , we ca n't actually directly observe dark matter yet - so the survey instead looks for its noticeable effect on galaxies .
studying this enables the predicted amounts of dark matter in a given area to be mapped , based on its gravitational effects .
` dark matter could equally be called "" transparent matter "" , because we see things behind it that gets distorted by gravity , ' dr bridle told mailonline .
in the map she explained we 're seeing about 150 times the area of the full moon , which is about 0.4 per cent of the whole sky .
the goal of the des is to map 12.5 per cent of the entire sky , creating a 3d map of dark matter - and dark energy .
` it is amazing to see a map of the dark matter over such a large region of the sky , and the full dark energy survey mass map will be more than 30 times bigger still , ' dr bridle said in a separate statement .
` analysis of the clumpiness of the dark matter in the maps will also allow us to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy , believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up . '
this mosaic image shows the different telescope shots that were combined to make the dark matter map .
the survey has just completed its second year .
as scientists expand their search they 'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter
the survey has just completed its second year .
as scientists expand their search , they 'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter .
those theories suggest that , since there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible matter , galaxies will form where there are large concentrations of dark matter ( and hence stronger gravity ) present .
so far , the des analysis backs this up .
the maps show large filaments of matter along which visible galaxies and galaxy clusters lie and cosmic voids where very few galaxies reside .
follow-up studies of some of the enormous filaments and voids , and the enormous volume of data , collected throughout the survey will reveal more about this interplay of mass and light .
these maps show how the amount of dark matter corresponds to the formation rate of galaxies .
on the left , galaxies can be seen near dark matter clumps ( in red ) , and further away from sparse regions ( blue ) .
the image on the right shows some of the regions of sky that were studied
the team at manchester analysed 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies to make the map .
the process of measuring the galaxies is so complex and time consuming that some of the world 's largest supercomputers are needed to do it .
each time a new catalogue is made it takes about as much computing power as running 500 ordinary desktop computers for two weeks .
` we have to measure the shape of each galaxy - how distorted it is - with extremely high precision , about one part in 1000 , ' said dr joe zuntz , also of the university of manchester , who has been making the measurements .
the survey uses the 13ft ( four metres ) victor m. blanco telescope ( middle ) located at the cerro tololo inter-american observatory ( ctio ) in chile , outfitted with a newly designed , state-of-the-art dark energy camera ( decam ) .
it will be completed by 2018 , mapping dark matter of an eighth of the sky in the process
dark matter , the mysterious substance that makes up 85 per cent of all matter in the universe , is invisible to even the most sensitive astronomical instruments because it does not emit or block light .
but its effects can be seen using a technique called gravitational lensing - studying the distortion that occurs when the gravitational pull of dark matter bends light around distant galaxies .
understanding how the clumpiness of dark matter changes with time will reveal the nature of the enigmatic dark energy , which is the ultimate goal of the survey .
the dark matter map released makes use of early des observations and covers only about three percent of the area of sky des will document over its five-year mission .","The largest high-definition map of dark matter has been created by the University of Manchester, covering 0.4% of the sky.

"manchester united have ramped up their efforts to sign psv eindhoven star memphis depay by making an official approach for the 21-year-old .
the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .
van gaal is already familiar with the qualities of depay having named him in his 23-man world cup squad last year as holland finished third in brazil .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .

the 21-year-old took his tally to 20 on saturday psv eindhoven beat heerenveen 4-1 to win the dutch championship on saturday for the first time in seven seasons .
the dutch league 's leading scorer doubled the hosts ' lead midway through the first half with a stunning free kick after luuk de jong headed them ahead early on .
heerenveen midfielder joey van den berg pulled a goal back for his side before de jong restored the two-goal advantage just before half-time and luciano narsingh added a fourth late on .

psv eindhoven won there first eredivisie title in seven years after beating heerenveen 4-1 on saturday
depay ( right ) celebrates the dutch giants ' success with manager phillip cocu after the match
born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-20 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.
having impressed in brazil , depay was nominated for the tournament 's ` best young player ' award but lost out to france midfielder paul pogba .

denies allegations : james evans who runs premiere photo allegedly did n't apologize for the racial slur and told the couple to ` sue ' him
attorney cathy hale who is representing the couple said that the sister of the bride waited to tell her about what happened until after the wedding because she did n't want to ruin her special day or upset her .

hale says that when the husband heard about the photos at the wedding he was horrified and called james evans of premiere photo .
the groom claims evans did n't even apologize .
` sue me , ' james evan 's reportedly replied .
hale told click2houston that her clients did n't want to file a lawsuit but they finally decided to press charges after evans ` did nothing ' about the racist comments .
the couple is suing the company under the texas deceptive trade practices act claiming that premiere photo practiced ` negligence and breach on contract . '
when eyewitness news reached out to evans and his attorney , christine kirchner , they declined an on-camera interview but gave the same responses they gave in civil court .

evans has denied all allegations and claimed that at a party of 103 people , there is no evidence linking the company to the offensive caption .
evans also said the married couple gave ` no sign of any mental anguish . '
hale disagrees and says her clients want an apology at the very least .
mediation is scheduled for tomorrow morning but if the parties do n't reach an agreement then the case is set for trial in july .

england full back mike brown admits he is unsure when he will return to action for club side harlequins
brown is determined not to suffer an extended break - so will not rush himself back to action ahead of time .
` it was just after the france game , there was n't one incident where i was dizzy or concussed , but after the game i just did n't feel quite right , ' said brown .
` i had a headache the sunday and monday , so just being cautious with it , i do n't want to get into the situation where you get a few knockouts or something .
` you do n't want to be into a situation where you 're out for a long time like johnny sexton or geoff parling or something like that .
` so with what 's coming up at the end of the year , everyone 's being cautious , and i 'm being cautious as well .
george north will not play against clermont auvergne on saturday and will see a neurosurgeon
north suffered his fourth quick-fire concussion after being knocked out against wasps on friday night
` i think it 's just ongoing to see how i am stage by stage .
` i 'll just see how i am with the stages , do the 20-minute bike , see how i am after that and take it from there . '
brown was knocked out cold in england 's 47-17 victory over italy at twickenham in the second round of rbs 6 nations action in february .
the harlequins flyer had hoped to recover in time to face ireland in dublin on march 1 , but pulled out in the build-up .

"smartphone use may be to blame for a drop in the number of times couples are having sex each month , a leading expert has suggested .

this was compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990 , according to research published in prof spiegelhalter 's book sex by numbers .
according to the daily telegraph he told bbc radio 15 's woman 's hour programme : ` we used to have a very big separation between our public lives and our private lives - now they are so mixed up and integrated .
` people are checking their emails all the time , you do not have the same sort of quiet empty time that there used to be . '
in his book , prof spiegelhalter pointed to a number of possible factors for the decline in sexual activity with one possible explanation being that more people are living on their own .
passion killed : people are check their emails ` all the time ' , according to professor david spiegelhalter , a statistician at cambridge university ( file picture )
but he added : ` a more realistic explanation is that as we 've become better connected technologically , our lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home , work and the outside world .
this has squeezed out time we would have spent with our other halves .
the statistician quotes catherine mercer , a researcher on the british national survey , as saying : ` with an increasing number of competing demands on our time , sex just falls down our list of priorities . '
she adds that dealing with work emails late in the evening can mean that ` come bedtime , we 're just still too connected with everyone and everything out there to be able to focus just on our partner . '","The frequency of sexual activity among British couples has decreased since the emergence of the internet, with a typical couple now having sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990.

"big beauty : tibetan mastiffs can weigh 80 kg
just a year ago they could command prices of up to £ 1.2 million each .
but tibetan mastiffs are now so unpopular in china they are being sent to slaughterhouses -- and their meat put into cheap hotpots .
the dogs ' dramatic decline in fortune is being partly blamed on the chinese government 's wide-reaching anti-corruption crackdown .
previously , wealthy businessmen would give the prized mastiffs to officials in the hope of influencing their decisions .
luo yi , general manager of china 's largest tibetan mastiff puppy farm , told people 's daily online : ` the anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift . '
it is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50 kg in several chinese cities - including beijing , zhengzhou , shanghai and tianjin - has had a huge impact on the breed 's popularity .
tibetan mastiffs -- which were traditionally used in tibet to herd other animals and are known for their loyalty - can weigh up to 80 kg .
china 's mastiff market collapse was revealed after animal-welfare workers rescued a group of the dogs that were being transported to a slaughterhouse .
the abattoir they were heading to provides hotpot meat for restaurants .
the dogs ' skin can also be used for leather belts .
rescuers said they found the 20 mastiffs in cramped cages .
a third of the dogs were already dead and none had been given food or water for three days .
several were suffering from broken bones .
shocking trade : twenty tibetan mastiffs were recently found crammed into cages on their way to a slaughterhouse like the dogs in this picture - taken on a motorway in the chinese capital beijing in 2009
it is feared that across china hundreds of the dogs are meeting such a cruel fate .
mastiffs are also being stolen from the streets by ruthless gangs , who sell them to the slaughterhouses , say animal charities .
unscrupulous breeders are also offloading their ` imperfect ' specimens to the abattoirs .
luo yi , whose puppy farm is in tibet , said some of his fellow breeders had damaged the quality of the breed to make more money .
` driven by profits there was a lot of cross-breeding which resulted in a deterioration of the tibetan mastiff in terms of appearance as well as temperament , ' he explained .
there was now a glut of poor-quality dogs that ca n't be sold , he added .
loyal : tibetan mastiffs , like the one here , were originally used by people in tibet to herd other animals
in their heyday : a visitor plays with one of the dogs at a tibetan mastiff show in shenyang city four years ago
meanwhile , chen youjun a specialist in tibetan mastiff photography , said : ` the rapid pace of urbanisation across china has made more and more people now realise tibetan mastiffs are not animals well-suited to city living . '
the breed 's boom began in 2005 and led to the dogs being seen as status symbols .
just 13 months ago one puppy sold for £ 1.2 million , which is thought to be the highest price ever paid for a dog .
a property develop bought the golden-haired one-year-old from breeder zhang gengyun in the eastern province of zhejiang .
mr zhang said of his dogs : ` they have lion 's blood and are top-of-the-range mastiff studs . '

every woman surveyed in paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city 's public transport
the poll of 600 women from the area around paris found that half of those interviewed said they had first suffered harassment under the age of 18 .
harassment can range from "" insults to other intimidating behaviour ( insistent flirting , whistling , comments on appearance ) , to sex attacks or rape , "" it said .
the problem meant that six out of ten women were afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men .
often "" invisible "" because unreported , these physical and verbal attacks limit "" the freedom of women , because they are often obligated to alter their daily lives : changing their routes , modes of transportation , schedules , attitudes and clothing in order to avoid confrontation , "" the report handed to the french women 's rights ministry this week , claimed .
the result was to "" exclude women from the public arena "" , it said .
pascale boisard , president of the high council for gender equality , which compiled the report , told le parisien she had not realised that "" the problem was quite this widespread "" .
the poll led to calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains .

"have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door , been woken by a facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger ?
to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products .
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )
losing your keys ( 37 per cent )
being stuck in traffic when already late ( 35 per cent )
losing an important paper or document ( 33 per cent )
nowhere to park ( 32 per cent )
printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost

a northumbria police spokesman said the funds would be allocated ` in the same manner that victim support were directly funded by the moj ' .
but critics have described her selection of charity as ` inappropriate ' and a conflict of interest .

keith vaz accused the force of creating its own ` soap opera '
` i am confident the team of coordinators will show that the decisions taken to create victims first northumbria were the right ones . '
mrs sim has already announced that she will be retiring from the force in june .
she was previously accused of bullying staff and faced an investigation that was spearheaded by ms baird , her co-director at victims first northumbria .
a ministry of justice spokesman confirmed it would investigate the circumstances to conclude whether any conflict of interest rules had been broken .
` the moj requires pccs not to be subject to conflicts of interest when providing victims services and has the power to investigate any possible conflict of interest and to cease funding if such a conflict is established . '
victims first northumbria was established after the number of people contacting its predecessor , victim support , plummeted .
but sources say many may be reluctant to confide in a service that is partly run by mrs sim who faced misconduct proceedings over alleged workplace bullying before announcing her retirement last week .

"manchester united have ramped up their efforts to sign psv eindhoven star memphis depay by making an official approach for the 21-year-old .
the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .
van gaal is already familiar with the qualities of depay having named him in his 23-man world cup squad last year as holland finished third in brazil .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .

the 21-year-old took his tally to 20 on saturday psv eindhoven beat heerenveen 4-1 to win the dutch championship on saturday for the first time in seven seasons .
the dutch league 's leading scorer doubled the hosts ' lead midway through the first half with a stunning free kick after luuk de jong headed them ahead early on .
heerenveen midfielder joey van den berg pulled a goal back for his side before de jong restored the two-goal advantage just before half-time and luciano narsingh added a fourth late on .
it is a 22nd league championship for psv , who are second only to ajax ( 33 titles ) in holland .

depay ( right ) celebrates the dutch giants ' success with manager phillip cocu after the match
born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-13 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.
having impressed in brazil , depay was nominated for the tournament 's ` best young player ' award but lost out to france midfielder paul pogba .

and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .

with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb
pablo gives up his camera for a moment , though , as latvian ilze captures her spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road
while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through turkey is n't one of them
rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .

` people are checking their emails all the time , you do not have the same sort of quiet empty time that there used to be . '

passion killed : people are check their emails ` all the time ' , according to professor david spiegelhalter , a statistician at cambridge university ( file picture )
but he added : ` a more realistic explanation is that as we 've become better connected technologically , our lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home , work and the outside world .
this has squeezed out time we would have spent with our other halves .
the statistician quotes catherine mercer , a researcher on the british national survey , as saying : ` with an increasing number of competing demands on our time , sex just falls down our list of priorities . '

'","The frequency of sexual activity among British couples has decreased since the emergence of the internet, with a typical couple now having sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990.

"big beauty : tibetan mastiffs can weigh 80 kg
just a year ago they could command prices of up to £ 1.2 million each .
but tibetan mastiffs are now so unpopular in china they are being sent to slaughterhouses -- and their meat put into cheap hotpots .
the dogs ' dramatic decline in fortune is being partly blamed on the chinese government 's wide-reaching anti-corruption crackdown .
previously , wealthy businessmen would give the prized mastiffs to officials in the hope of influencing their decisions .
luo yi , general manager of china 's largest tibetan mastiff puppy farm , told people 's daily online : ` the anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift . '
it is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50 kg in several chinese cities - including beijing , zhengzhou , shanghai and tianjin - has had a huge impact on the breed 's popularity .
tibetan mastiffs -- which were traditionally used in tibet to herd other animals and are known for their loyalty - can weigh up to 80 kg .
china 's mastiff market collapse was revealed after animal-welfare workers rescued a group of the dogs that were being transported to a slaughterhouse .
the abattoir they were heading to provides hotpot meat for restaurants .
the dogs ' skin can also be used for leather belts .
rescuers said they found the 20 mastiffs in cramped cages .
a third of the dogs were already dead and none had been given food or water for three days .
several were suffering from broken bones .
shocking trade : twenty tibetan mastiffs were recently found crammed into cages on their way to a slaughterhouse like the dogs in this picture - taken on a motorway in the chinese capital beijing in 2009
it is feared that across china hundreds of the dogs are meeting such a cruel fate .
mastiffs are also being stolen from the streets by ruthless gangs , who sell them to the slaughterhouses , say animal charities .
unscrupulous breeders are also offloading their ` imperfect ' specimens to the abattoirs .
luo yi , whose puppy farm is in tibet , said some of his fellow breeders had damaged the quality of the breed to make more money .
` driven by profits there was a lot of cross-breeding which resulted in a deterioration of the tibetan mastiff in terms of appearance as well as temperament , ' he explained .
there was now a glut of poor-quality dogs that ca n't be sold , he added .
loyal : tibetan mastiffs , like the one here , were originally used by people in tibet to herd other animals
in their heyday : a visitor plays with one of the dogs at a tibetan mastiff show in shenyang city four years ago
meanwhile , chen youjun a specialist in tibetan mastiff photography , said : ` the rapid pace of urbanisation across china has made more and more people now realise tibetan mastiffs are not animals well-suited to city living . '
the breed 's boom began in 2005 and led to the dogs being seen as status symbols .
just 13 months ago one puppy sold for £ 1.2 million , which is thought to be the highest price ever paid for a dog .
a property develop bought the golden-haired one-year-old from breeder zhang gengyun in the eastern province of zhejiang .
mr zhang said of his dogs : ` they have lion 's blood and are top-of-the-range mastiff studs . '
most expensive dog in the world : the gold-maned tibetan mastiff pup ( left ) sold last year in east china for £ 1.2 million .
the red pup of the same breed ( right ) fetched nearly £ 600,011 .
the dogs are seen with a model","The Tibetan Mastiff, once a highly prized and expensive dog breed in China, has significantly decreased in popularity due to the country's anti-corruption crackdown and city bans on owning large dogs. The decline in demand has led to many Tibetan Mastiffs being sent to slaughterhouses, with their meat used for cheap hotpots and their skin for leather belts. Animal-welfare workers have rescued several of these dogs from cruel conditions, as they were being transported to slaughterhouses without food or water. The breed's decline is also attributed to unscrupulous breeding practices and urbanization, making it difficult for the dogs to adapt to city living.",databricks/dbrx-instruct,0.74898,0.63767,0.8759,1,1.0
"have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door , been woken by a facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger ?
to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products .
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * )
losing your keys ( 37 per cent )
being stuck in traffic when already late ( 35 per cent )
losing an important paper or document ( 33 per cent )
nowhere to park ( 32 per cent )
printer not working when you need to print something ( 31 per cent )
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent )
discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo ( 30 per cent )
dealing with machine operated customer service ( 26 per cent )
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent )
* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called snooze , shown , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep
whichever tweet has the most retweets , with the #everydayfix hashtag , by 40 april will go into a kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development .
` we 've seen the great british designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies , ' said paul smyth , co-founder of makerversity .
` through the direct line everyday fix event , we 've been able to extend our role as "" fixers "" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation 's everyday emergencies , ' added john shaw , head of r&d and innovation at direct line .
of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .
and as another solution to your phone running out of battery , one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies .
products that did n't make the final shortlist included the parking pin , shown .
you could leave this in a parking space , and it will alert you when the space is free , so you can park your car
the relay app , shown , would let you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","The passage describes the conviction of Leonie Granger, a 25-year-old aspiring model, for her involvement in the manslaughter of professional gambler Mehmet Hassan.

"( cnn ) he was known as the american mouthpiece of al qaeda , speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that 's devoted blood and resources to attacking it .
the white house announced thursday that adam gadahn , 36 , was killed in january in a u.s. government counterterrorism operation .
neither he nor ahmed farouq -- another u.s. citizen and al qaeda operative who died in what the white house said was "" likely a separate "" operation -- was specifically targeted , according to the statement .
warren weinstein , a u.s. citizen who was abducted by al qaeda in pakistan in 2011 , died along with another hostage , italian giovanni lo porto , in the attack that killed farouq , according to the white house .
white house : u.s. hostage killed in strike on al qaeda
while he was n't one of al qaeda 's top leaders , gadahn was one of its most prominent members , given his many statements on behalf of the organization .
also known as azzam the american , he was born in 1978 .
his parents changed their name from pearlman to gadahn after their marriage .
he grew up on a farm in rural california and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents , who were jewish .
he converted to islam in 1995 and left the united states for pakistan three years later .
his father said gadahn last contacted the family in 2002 .
a former al qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting gadahn at peshawar airport in september 1998 .
gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .
cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda .
among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2033 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy .
gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child .
cnn 's steve almasy contributed to this report .","The passage discusses the death of American-born al-Qaeda member, Adam Gadahn, in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation in January.

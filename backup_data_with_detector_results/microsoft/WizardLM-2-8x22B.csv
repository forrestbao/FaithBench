'It's not as though I was watching hoping he wouldn't score for England, I'm genuinely pleased for him and fair play to him – it was a great goal,' Merson said. 'It's just a matter of opinion, and my opinion was that he got pulled off after half an hour at Manchester United in front of Roy Hodgson, so he shouldn't have been in the squad.

"Chelsea have made an offer for FC Tokyo's 22-year-old forward Yoshinori Muto, according to club president Naoki Ogane. The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the £200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March . FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto .

International goals: 1 . Did you know? Muto graduated from Keio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago . Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London. He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue. A £4million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club . Muto, pictured in action against Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season . The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year . He has continued his fine form during the current campaign, helping his club to third place in the division with three goals in four games. Yokohama Rubber - one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers - will become Chelsea's official shirt sponsors from the start of the 2015-16 season.

"Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. 'Epidemic': By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight (file photo) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.","A large-scale study has discovered that infants who receive antibiotics during their first six months of life are more likely to be overweight by the age of two.

The research indicated that children, especially boys, who were prescribed antibiotics as babies had a higher chance of being overweight and were also slightly taller. The study suggested a potential link between antibiotic use and weight gain, possibly due to the drugs altering the gut microbiota, which could affect food digestion and appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the need for judicious use of antibiotics in infancy, as their overuse might contribute to the global childhood obesity epidemic. The findings add to existing concerns about the over-prescription of antibiotics, which includes the risk of antibiotic resistance and the potential for common infections to become more difficult to treat.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.97603,0.85562,0.96526,1,1.0
"This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box. The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera.

"Police are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy, it was revealed yesterday. Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s . But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother’s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. ‘That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,’ he told the Sunday People. ‘I was staggered. The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me, holding me in the chair. Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence . ‘They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room.’ Afterwards, Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet. A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House – so he packed his bags immediately. Mr Lawler, a former Port of Liverpool police officer, said he was ‘haunted’ by the incident for years. After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace, but was twice rebuffed. Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard. A retired royal aide, who is now in his 80s, was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time. Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work ‘exhaustively and co-operatively’ with any police probe. A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment ‘as investigations continue’.","A former royal footman, Christopher Lawler, has accused palace aides of attempting to coerce him into an orgy at Clarence House in January 1978.

"Rome (CNN)Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea . CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","A total of 8,480 migrants were rescued from Friday to Monday as they attempted to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East, with the Italian coast guard receiving SOS calls from 20 distressed boats on Monday alone.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not know the exact reason Alexis Sanchez chose the Emirates Stadium over Anfield - but he is glad the Chile forward will be lining up for his side rather than against them for Liverpool on Saturday. Sanchez had his selection of clubs once Barcelona had decided to let him leave, and following the World Cup, the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under Wenger's expert guidance, going on to make an instant impression in English football. The French coach, however, admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards. Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal . Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (right) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club . 'At the end of the day, only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us. I don't know why he did that, but we are happy that he made that decision,' said Wenger of the £32million Chile forward, who has netted 19 goals so far. 'I was (aware of Liverpool's interest), but you never know if it is really true, but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez (from Barcelona). 'In the negotiations, yes, it is a strength - and it makes sense, an exchange and some money for Liverpool.' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around. 'If you look at the qualities, efficiency, work-rate, fighting spirit - (he is at the) top,' the Arsenal boss added. 'When it (the game) becomes flat, he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters.' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash, Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, who has so far rejected a new contract offer. Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish, Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge. 'He has done very well. I think he found a solution at the right time,' the Arsenal manager said. 'They did well last season too, they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League, which is absolutely fantastic.' Wenger has moved to play down speculation linking him with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling .","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is pleased that Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez chose to join Arsenal instead of Liverpool, although he is unsure of the exact reasons behind Sanchez's decision.

Wenger acknowledges that Liverpool's interest in Sanchez might have been related to their negotiations with Barcelona over Luis Suarez's transfer.

Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space.

He continued: ""They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth.""

He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

"Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific.

"Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January . A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her.

Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation .

At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all.

"A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.","1. Ian Guffick, a teacher at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, was banned from teaching after he allowed pupils to change their answers on SATs exams after the exam session had ended, and also altered some answers himself.
2. The conduct panel heard that Guffick's actions led to the annulment of all SATs results for the entire school for the year 2014.
3. Guffick admitted to the allegations, which were deemed unacceptable professional conduct, but claimed he only asked pupils to make their answers more legible, not to change them.
4. The National College for Teaching and Leadership panel found Guffick's actions to be dishonest but not fraudulent or seriously dishonest.
5. Despite expressing regret and explaining his actions, Guffick was banned from teaching for at least two years by Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.
6. The decision to ban Guffick was made because his actions had a serious impact on the school, leading to the annulment of its SATs results, and because he acted deliberately without duress.
7. Guffick was given the opportunity to appeal the decision to the High Court within 28 days.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.96689,0.93778,0.98582,1,1.0

"The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday.

The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team.

Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home.

"Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’","Nathan Hughes, a Wasps No 8, successfully appealed a three-match ban imposed for a collision with George North during a match on March 27. Initially, Hughes was deemed 'reckless' for not preventing his knee from hitting North's head as he scored a try, resulting in a red card and subsequent suspension. Despite no intent to harm, the disciplinary panel sanctioned Hughes, sparking widespread criticism and support for the player, including from high-profile figures like James Haskell, Andy Goode, Austin Healey, and Joe Marler.

The appeal, lodged by Wasps, was upheld after the appeal panel reviewed new evidence, concluding that the incident was accidental and no foul play was involved. Hughes, who missed Wasps' Champions Cup quarter-final due to the suspension, is now cleared to play immediately but will likely return to action against Exeter on April 26.

"(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","A striking sunset with a deep reddish color was observed in Washington, captured by Seattle photographer Tim Durkan.

Despite rescue crews extinguishing the flames, the smoke was carried across the Pacific Ocean to the Pacific Northwest by atmospheric winds, affecting parts of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The intense red sunsets are a result of smoke particles in the atmosphere filtering out shorter wavelength colors, allowing red and orange light to dominate the sky, especially during sunrises and sunsets when light has to pass through more atmosphere.

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.","The passage summarizes a youth match between Manchester United's and Manchester City's Under 18 teams, referred to as the 'mini-derby.' Manchester United won the match 1-0 with a free-kick goal by Callum Gribbin. The game featured a high number of English players, with 13 out of 22 being English and 10 of those being from Manchester. The match was played at Altrincham's Moss Lane ground with free entry, attracting around 1,000 spectators.

The first half was evenly matched, with Marcus Wood of City and Marcus Rashford of United having the best chances. United's Gribbin, known for his skills, scored the only goal of the game in the second half with a well-placed free-kick. United had opportunities to extend their lead, while City's Javairo Dilrosun nearly equalized with a free-kick that went over the net.

The victory puts United two points behind league leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand, while City has lost both of their recent matches. The match showcased the talent of young players from both teams, suggesting that they may have promising futures in the senior leagues, despite concerns about the lack of opportunities for young English players.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.81701,0.69313,0.97654,1,1.0

"(CNN)The parents of the youngest victim of the Boston Marathon bombings are making an emotional, passionate plea to take the death penalty off the table for the man convicted in the case. Last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 charges he faced related to the bombings at the 2013 race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. A look at all of the charges . The sentencing phase begins Tuesday, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. It is expected to last four weeks. The 13th Juror: Now it gets real . In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe, Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son, Martin. Their daughter, Jane, also was severely injured. ""Our family has grieved, buried our young son, battled injuries, and endured numerous surgeries -- all while trying to rebuild lives that will never be the same,"" they said in the Globe column titled ""To end the anguish, drop the death penalty."" ""We sat in the courtroom, day after day, bearing witness to overwhelming evidence that included graphic video and photographs, replicated bombs, and even the clothes our son wore his last day alive."" They said they understood the ""heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed."" ""We were there. We lived it. The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul."" But now the Richards are urging the Justice Department to bring the case to a close. ""We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal,"" they wrote. They go on to say: ""We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives. We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring."" Martin Richard and two others were killed and more 200 people wounded when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line on April 15, 2013. Tsarnaev was convicted last week, while his brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police two years ago. The Richards never mention Tsarnaev by name. They stress that they were only speaking for themselves when they argue against the death penalty. ""We believe that now is the time to turn the page, end the anguish, and look toward a better future -- for us, for Boston, and for the country,"" they wrote.","The parents of Martin Richard, the youngest victim of the Boston Marathon bombings, have publicly appealed for the death penalty to be removed as a sentencing option for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the man convicted of the bombings. Despite Tsarnaev being found guilty on all 30 charges related to the 2013 bombings and the subsequent violent events, Bill and Denise Richard argue that a life sentence without parole and without the possibility of appeal would be a more appropriate punishment. They believe that years of appeals associated with the death penalty would only prolong their family's suffering, reminding them of the painful loss of their son and the severe injuries sustained by their daughter, Jane. The Richards emphasize the personal toll the bombings have taken on their family and express their desire to move forward without the prolonged legal process that a death penalty sentence would entail. They advocate for a resolution that allows for healing and a focus on the future for themselves, the city of Boston, and the nation.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.87224,0.96323,0.97761,1,1.0
"These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms, multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant. The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner £400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period. The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests.

"(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: ""Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival."" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to ""reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred."" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station.

Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points .

But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post.

Napoli had a potential penalty claim in the first half, but it was not strongly contested.

"There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action.  Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans. The managers on the touchline during Saturday's goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium .","The passage describes a lackluster season for Doncaster Rovers, who are stuck in mid-table in League One. The recent match against Fleetwood Town, which ended in a 0-0 draw, was particularly uneventful, as Fleetwood's play-off hopes had already faded. The match's uneventful nature posed a challenge for Doncaster's media team when compiling highlights, leading them to produce an exceptionally brief 27-second video featuring only 14 seconds of actual match play, including the kickoff, a goal kick, and the final whistle. The video, described as a must-see for football fans, reflects the uninspiring game that tested the patience of even the most dedicated supporters.

"Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch. But that doesn’t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid  a stroke. Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera, Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage. The fish begins relaxing in the man's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger . The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man’s fingers. The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation. Repeating the process, the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man’s hand to be stroked again. Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers. The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers . Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more. The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish, clearly saddened by this, following it up to the surface of the water. According to Mr Giroux, who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel, the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish. The fish swims away from the man's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged . But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet. He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable. After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn’t play with it on a daily basis. The fish begins swimming around the man's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand . The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day. The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986.","The passage describes the unique relationship between Roland Giroux and his pet blood parrot cichlid, a hybrid fish bred in Taiwan in 1986. Giroux is able to interact with his fish by touching and massaging it, which is unusual for marine pets. The fish demonstrates a remarkable level of comfort and even seems to enjoy the interaction, as it relaxes in Giroux's hand, allows itself to be stroked, and returns to his hand after swimming away. The fish also displays affection by swimming up Giroux's arm and circling his fingers. This interaction developed over time, starting with hand-feeding frozen blood worms, leading to the fish becoming more sociable and eventually enjoying being stroked. Giroux noticed the fish's frustration if it was not played with daily. He would spend at least 15 minutes each day massaging and playing with the fish. Initially, the cichlid shared its tank with two other fish, but they were removed due to bullying. The video of their interaction shows the fish's trust and bond with Giroux, as it buries its face in his hand and follows his hand to the surface of the water when he removes it from the tank.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.96487,0.88564,0.92972,1,1.0
"There would have been no mercy in the dressing room. Nothing is sacred in the team. When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said: ‘Mind that locker, Stokesey.’ It was here, of course, that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team. Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team . Stokes (left) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England . But Stokes (right) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores . Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs. I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who cannot capture the imagination. He has something about him, as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson’s face during the Ashes series. He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return. But I do believe he will need careful man-managing. Peter Moores, England’s coach, dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right. The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on. England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on. It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad. What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed. He can be feisty and fiery as long as it’s natural but his aggression has to be controlled. You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets. Stokes (second left) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team . Stokes (left) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test . England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential . Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally. There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible. This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game. They can only get better and that’s an exciting prospect.","1. Ben Stokes has a reputation for being a fiery, aggressive player in the England cricket team.
2. He previously broke his wrist punching a locker at the Kensington Oval, highlighting his need to channel his aggression constructively.
3. Stokes' character is appreciated for bringing excitement to the game, contrasting with the perception of players as 'robots'.
4. After a clash with Marlon Samuels during a Test match, Stokes responded positively following a conversation with England coach Peter Moores.
5. Stokes' aggression, such as standing up to Mitchell Johnson during the Ashes, is valued, but it requires careful management to ensure it benefits his performance.
6. There is a balance to be struck in allowing Stokes' natural exuberance while ensuring it does not lead to consistent lows in performance.
7. Stokes should avoid trying to live up to his reputation in a way that could pigeonhole him, and his aggression should be a natural part of his game as long as it contributes to his performance in terms of runs and wickets.
8. England's team management wants Stokes to play as often as possible to help him reach his full potential.
9. There is a consideration for team selection, with the possibility of playing a second spinner, which could affect Stokes' or Chris Jordan's place in the team. However, England is keen to have both Stokes and Jordan play frequently to develop their international careers.
10. The upcoming summer is expected to require fewer spinners, making it an opportune time for Stokes and Jordan to establish themselves in the team.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.78242,0.89933,0.97959,1,1.0

"(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","200-228 Yazidis, primarily women, children, the ill, and the elderly, were released by ISIS in northern Iraq. The release was coordinated with the help of Arab tribal leaders and received by the Peshmerga, who then sent them to Irbil, the Kurdish regional capital. The exact reason for the release was unclear. This event follows previous releases of Yazidis by ISIS since their initial attack on Yazidi towns last year. The Yazidis, a minority group of Kurdish descent with a unique syncretic religion, have faced extreme persecution by ISIS, including killings, rape, and enslavement, leading to a significant humanitarian crisis. The international community has responded with humanitarian aid, rescue operations, and airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The Yazidi population in northern Iraq is estimated at 500,000, making up less than 1% of the country's population.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.97453,0.74256,0.96246,1,1.0

It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. 'There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'","Jamie Carragher, a former Liverpool defender, has expressed his support for Brendan Rodgers to continue as Liverpool's manager despite a season without trophies and a probable failure to finish in the top four.

"Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport . A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk. James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines.

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs . Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write. 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all: opportunity.'","Greg Dyke, the Football Association chairman, is advocating for significant changes in English football, including increasing the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 and redefining 'home-grown' to mean training in England before the age of 18 instead of 21. His proposals face opposition from the Premier League.

Five former England managers—Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson, and Steve McClaren—have publicly supported Dyke's reforms in a letter, as reported by the Daily Telegraph. They argue that the English game will suffer if these changes are not implemented, potentially harming England's chances of winning the World Cup.

The letter emphasizes the urgency of the situation, pointing out that only 36.8% of Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection. The former managers acknowledge that there are multiple reasons for England's lack of success since 1966 but highlight the shrinking pool of English talent in top-level football as a significant issue.

Despite these concerns, there is optimism due to the emergence of young talents like Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling, and Harry Kane. However, the managers stress that these players need more opportunities to play at the highest level to fulfill their potential. The letter calls for unity in the English game to support the FA's England Commission's proposals to improve the national team's fortunes.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.92595,0.92424,0.98467,1,1.0

"(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for ""Barbara,"" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the ""warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions."" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited ""three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,"" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. ""For her to go to Mexico,"" Mate said, ""It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from."" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to ""navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,"" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. ""Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,"" Mate said. Fourth baby orca born this season .","1. A North Pacific gray whale named Varvara has set a new record for the longest migration of a mammal, traveling nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers).
2. The study involving Varvara was conducted with the help of scientists from Oregon State University.
3. Varvara's journey began at her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island and ended in Baja, Mexico, after crossing the Pacific Ocean and traveling down the West Coast of the United States.
4. This migration surpassed the previous record held by a humpback whale that traveled a round trip of 10,190 miles between warm breeding waters and colder feeding areas.
5. Lead author Bruce Mate suggests that Varvara's extensive travel, which included visits to three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales, indicates that she may originally be from Mexico, challenging previous assumptions about her being an endangered western whale.
6. The findings raise questions about the genetic differentiation between eastern and western gray whales and imply that some western gray whales might actually be eastern grays, which is significant given the critically low population of western gray whales, estimated at around 150 individuals.

"Residents on the east coast of Japan's Hokkaido Island had an unexpected change of scenery this morning after 1,000ft of seabed was forced to the surface overnight. The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby, when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan .

An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window.

"Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.","1. Dr. Adrian Quarterman, a scientist from Dundee University, is developing a space laser system that could potentially heat homes by converting sunlight into energy using satellites equipped with mirrors and semiconductors.
2. This technology would make solar power viable in places like Scotland and could quickly restore power in disaster-stricken areas.
3. The system works by firing laser beams at solar panels on Earth to enhance the energy they collect.
4. Initial tests in Scotland have been successful, and further trials are planned for Portugal.
5. Unlike the destructive lasers depicted in science fiction and movies, these space lasers are not powerful enough to cause harm, with Dr. Quarterman emphasizing they would not be able to blind a pigeon.
6. There is a separate proposal by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo to attach a laser system to the International Space Station aimed at clearing space debris by pushing it into Earth's atmosphere to burn up.
7. The Tokyo system's laser would target small pieces of debris up to 62 miles away and, like Dr. Quarterman's lasers, would not be powerful enough to be used as a weapon.
8. Despite the peaceful intentions, Dr. Quarterman acknowledges there may be concerns about who controls such satellite-based laser systems.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.89037,0.90129,0.9481,1,1.0

Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother.

Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties.

Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'","54-year-old Stephen Munden, a convicted paedophile with a history of sexual offenses against young girls, has gone missing from a psychiatric unit near Hook, Hampshire.

"A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: ‘I stopped because I couldn’t see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.’ Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff . The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to ‘use an ATM’ before making a run for it. ‘The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi – I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,’ Mr Robinson told the inquest. ‘Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.’ Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker. Paramedics arrived at the scene after his body was discovered in the morning by a dog walker . A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out.  Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were . Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Barkley said: ‘It is likely that he became disorientated and there is no evidence that he knew where he was at the time. ‘There is no way he could have known the danger that lay in front of him. The following day with the benefit of light it was clear the danger he faced by the sheer drop off the cliff just yards beyond the fence.’ Mr Phillips worked for Pretty Green, the clothing label run by Oasis star Liam Gallagher. He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend’s house but he and his friends didn’t have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by ‘dodging’ the fare. Mr Phillips ran off into the ‘pitch black’ and fell down a cliff at the end of the disused Northern Promenade – also called The Dardanelles. Police search the scene at the bottom of the cliff where his body was discovered .","23-year-old accountant Jacob Phillips died after falling down a 70ft cliff in Penarth, South Wales, while attempting to evade a taxi fare. After a night out in Cardiff with friends, Phillips and his companions, Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson, took a taxi to Penarth but did not have enough money to pay for the ride. They planned to use an ATM, but instead, they fled from the taxi. Phillips ran in a different direction from his friends and, in the dark, jumped over a fence, leading to his fatal fall. The incident occurred in December, and Phillips' body was found the following day by a dog walker at the base of the cliff. The taxi driver, Dave Sidaway, was unaware of the danger and would not have left Phillips if he had known their location. The coroner, Andrew Barkley, concluded that Phillips' death was accidental, noting that he likely became disoriented in the dark and was unaware of the cliff's proximity.

"Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video . The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer . Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved . This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.","Last summer, thousands of holidaymakers experienced significant delays in receiving their passports, leading to a fiasco where many had to pay extra for expedited service or missed their trips altogether. Despite the chaos, which saw a backlog of over half a million passports, the passport agency reported a profit of £42 million. Managers at the agency received bonuses up to £3,500, while the majority of affected travelers received no compensation.

The Home Affairs Committee, chaired by Keith Vaz, called for compensation for the affected families, but the government refused, fearing it would set a precedent. Between April of the previous year and January of the following year, only 2,191 compensation applications were approved, a negligible increase from the 2,077 approved the year before. The total compensation paid out was £203,066, with an average payout of £92.68. The Passport Office was unable to provide the number of rejected claims due to a failure in their customer complaint database.

The government's decision to not offer blanket refunds meant that many who paid extra or missed trips did not receive any financial reimbursement. For example, Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham lost nearly £1,500 on a trip to Morocco where Bean had planned to propose, despite applying for their passports ten weeks in advance and paying for an upgrade. The Passport Office's financial surplus during this period was £42.3 million, and in the previous fiscal year, managers received a total of £1.8 million in bonuses.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.98824,0.9488,0.96617,1,1.0

"Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer ""concrete solutions"". ""We want someone who can speak for the royal family,"" he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. ""We welcome it, we are ready for it,"" he said. ""We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary."" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. ""A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people"". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. ""We had an agreement with the crown prince,"" he said. ""The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue."" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was ""hopeful"" that he would ""do more than his predecessor"", Hillary Clinton. ""US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more."" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. ""If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. ""It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. ""So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy."" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for ""peaceful demonstrations"", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. ""It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government."" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. ""These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail.""","Sheikh Ali Salman, the leader of al-Wefaq, emphasized the need for the Bahraini government to offer concrete solutions and demonstrate willingness for meaningful national dialogue. He called for a representative of the royal family, specifically mentioning Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa, who is viewed as a reformist, to engage in discussions. The opposition is divided, with hardliners, including the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, opposing the recently agreed-upon dialogue process, fearing it will lead to more demands.

Despite the loss of faith among young protesters in the opposition parties, Sheikh Salman insisted that dialogue with reformist members of the royal family, such as the Crown Prince, is the only way forward. He referenced a seven-point plan agreed upon with the Crown Prince before the intervention of GCC troops, which would have transitioned Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy.

Sheikh Salman expressed hope that the new US Secretary of State, John Kerry, would take a firmer stance on human rights and democratic practices in Bahrain than his predecessor, Hillary Clinton. He criticized the UK's private approach to urging reform in Bahrain and called for public pressure to end violence and human rights abuses.

Al-Wefaq plans to continue organizing peaceful demonstrations despite the ban on public gatherings, as a means to exert pressure on the government. Sheikh Salman also demanded the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists, who were imprisoned on charges of plotting against the government, arguing that their inclusion is crucial for the success of any dialogue.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.95362,0.96571,0.98486,1,1.0
"He died at his home in Cambridge following an illness lasting several months, a statement on his website said. It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date. Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US. ""Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,"" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said. ""He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director."" The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: ""I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him."" Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: ""Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him. ""Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man. He had an amazing capacity to absorb information of all kinds and a really sure sense of how things would be if he really tried to reproduce conditions... a very genial person."" David Thomas from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London added: ""He always said I want the music to speak for itself because it can, it's good enough, it willâ€¦ a very pleasant and lovely man.""","The passage provides a summary of the life and achievements of Christopher Hogwood, a renowned conductor and early-music movement exponent, who passed away in Cambridge after a prolonged illness. His funeral will be private, with a public memorial service to be announced later. Hogwood was celebrated for his work with numerous prestigious orchestras worldwide. He established the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973, leading the ensemble across six continents for three decades and producing over 200 CDs, notably the first complete Mozart symphonies cycle on period instruments. His acclaimed recordings include a 1980 rendition of Handel's Messiah, which was recognized as one of the greatest recordings by BBC Music Magazine.

"In the year to the end of March, 57 victims of homicide (murders and culpable homicides) were recorded - down five on the previous 12 months. This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago. As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved. The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51% of homicides (29 cases) in 2015-16. Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife. While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime, the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue, because each of the lives lost is one life too many. ""There is a clear role across a range of public services, in addition to the critical work of our police, to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called 'casual' violence. ""We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime, while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others."" Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said: ""Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution. ""Last year when the Scottish government were heralding 'record low' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop, the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase. ""Meanwhile, sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45-year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27%.""

"Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike.

Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

"Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"". ""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. ""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already. ""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. ""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. ""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at."" But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods."" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. ""Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. ""That seems fairer to me,"" he added. The think tank also said the move would be ""extremely popular"" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be ""cleansed"" of ""hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices"". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced ""radical reforms"" to ""get Britain building"" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme ""set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes"". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure ""social housing goes to those in greatest need"", he added.","The passage discusses a report by think tank Policy Exchange, which proposes selling high-value vacant social homes to fund the construction of new social housing. The report suggests that this could raise £4.5 billion annually, enough to build between 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, potentially the largest social house building program since the 1970s. Policy Exchange's director, Neil O'Brien, argues that while social housing would still exist in expensive areas, there would be less of it, and that no one has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. He estimates that the scheme could reduce the social housing waiting list by about 500,000.

Downing Street supports the report, emphasizing that councils already have the option to sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing. The government believes this could help address the growing waiting list for social housing.

However, the Labour Party opposes the idea, stating that the coalition's policies are exacerbating the housing crisis. Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey suggests using a bank bonus tax to fund affordable housing and stimulate the construction industry.

The report defines expensive social housing as properties worth more than the regional average, which accounts for 21.8% of the UK's total social housing stock. Policy Exchange estimates that selling 3.5% of the total stock that becomes vacant each year could raise £5.5 billion, or £4.5 billion after debt repayment.

Critics of the proposal worry that it would lead to the displacement of low-income families from affluent areas, creating segregated communities. The National Housing Federation and Labour MP Karen Buck express concerns about the social consequences of such a policy.

In contrast, Housing Minister Grant Shapps supports the sell-off, citing the government's investment in affordable housing and the introduction of fixed-term tenancies to prioritize those in greatest need.

In summary, the passage outlines Policy Exchange's proposal to sell vacant high-value social homes to fund new social housing construction, with support from the government and opposition from the Labour Party and housing organizations, who are concerned about the social impact of the policy.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.89095,0.91694,0.96881,1,1.0

"Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months. It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a ""similar location and mechanism"", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking"", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: ""We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. ""We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. ""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. ""Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site. ""Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles). ""The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.""","1. Cuadrilla, the company conducting shale gas drilling, has suspended operations after a 1.5 magnitude tremor, the second in two months, occurred near Poulton-le-Fylde.
2. The British Geological Survey (BGS) reported that the recent tremor had a similar location and mechanism to an earlier one on 1 April.

4. Cuadrilla's CEO, Mark Miller, stated that the company is taking its responsibilities seriously and will analyze data and consult with experts before deciding whether to resume drilling, a process expected to take several weeks.
5. Fracking has been controversial in the US due to environmental concerns, including the potential for gas to leak into drinking water, possibly causing it to ignite.
6. The UK's Commons energy select committee has recommended that the government support fracking, suggesting that environmental issues seen in the US can be mitigated with strict regulation and industry best practices.

8. Since fracking began in Lancashire in March, there have been two minor earthquakes, including the most recent one.

"Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance. Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner.

"The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday. The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.""

"Pro-Kremlin party A Just Russia put forward both bills, and linked them directly to the situation in Ukraine. Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.","1. The pro-Kremlin party A Just Russia has introduced two bills in response to the situation in Ukraine, particularly in the Crimea region where there is significant separatist and pro-Russian sentiment.
2. The first bill proposes that a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be sufficient for a region to join the Russian Federation, altering the current requirement of a treaty between Russia and the neighboring state.
3. Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, argues that the existing law is inadequate for situations where a neighboring state is disintegrating and that Russia should be able to accept territories where the people have expressed a desire to join Russia.
4. The second bill aims to expedite the process of issuing Russian passports by waiving state tax fees, previous residence requirements, financial self-sufficiency criteria, and the need to renounce Ukrainian citizenship.
5. The bill is presented as a means to support Russian-speaking Ukrainians who are seen as defenseless against a perceived ""brown threat,"" a reference to World War Two fascists.

"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

McLaren has an impressive record with 182 grand prix wins, a 23.18% win rate, 12 drivers' world championships, and 8 constructors' titles. Despite their recent poor performance, they still boast two world champions in their lineup, including Fernando Alonso, who is considered by some to be the best driver on the grid.

McLaren's decline began in 2013 due to issues with chassis design, contrasting with their previous successes, particularly in partnership with Honda, which included a near-perfect season in 1988 with 15 out of 16 races won. The team's last constructors' title was in 1998, and despite occasional wins and a close call in 2007, they have not secured a title since. Their history is marked by cycles of success and failure, with significant victories in the 1970s and a resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by a period of scandal and decline.

Ron Dennis has been a central figure in McLaren's history, leading the team to dominance and returning to steer the team after the disastrous 2013 season. Despite their current challenges, Dennis remains confident that McLaren will eventually overcome their difficulties with the Honda power-unit and return to winning ways, breaking Mercedes' current dominance. The team's belief in their potential for a comeback is strong, but as of now, it remains unproven, with the future success of both the team and Alonso's career hanging in the balance.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.62804,0.33696,0.71619,1,1.0

"Let's not forget the traditional argument with your other half about whose job it was to buy all the batteries for the children's new toys - which are currently a source of tension because nobody can turn them on. Am I right? If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online: Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. ""There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,"" he says. ""The chat room is like the foyer of a church."" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. ""We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,"" says Mr Parker. ""The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity."" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. ""Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,"" he says. ""The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. ""It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world."" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one ""Joseph Carpenter"" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. ""It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,"" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. ""The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago."" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being ""too religious"". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. ""We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,"" says founder Roald Lidal. ""One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,"" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. ""There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga."" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. ""I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,"" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. ""The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly."" ""Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,"" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. ""He was a great communicator.""

"Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is ""a new low"". Investing Solutions said ""the bulk"" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help ""the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress"". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing ""the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation"". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. ""It's all about the money, it's not about the people,"" he added. ""I thought inspections would be made."" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a ""dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable"". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low."" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords ""who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients"". He also said his company was ""genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property"". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have ""authority from the relevant parties"" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.

"The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: ""I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves."" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. ""Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,"" said Bennett. ""To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine."" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: ""I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands."" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a ""litany of information"" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were ""several reasons to approve the fight"". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. ""I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,"" said Bennett. ""He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. ""Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. ""Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. ""That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight."" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: ""He's good to go."" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an ""out of control"" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.","1. Conor McGregor, a former five-weight world champion in UFC, submitted a waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) to request the use of 8oz gloves for his upcoming boxing match against Floyd Mayweather. The NAC, which sanctions the bout, expected this request and will debate the matter on 16 August.

2. The standard for fights at 154 lbs is 10oz gloves, which offer more cushioning and are less punishing than the 8oz gloves requested by Mayweather. Mayweather, who is coming out of retirement for this fight, had previously expressed his intention to wear 8oz gloves on social media but had not submitted the necessary waiver until McGregor did so.

3. NAC rules allow for the use of 8oz gloves in fights between 135lbs and 147lbs if both fighters agree and sign waivers, and the NAC approves the request based on the health and safety of the fighters. The NAC's executive director, Bob Bennett, noted that he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at the 154lbs weight class before.

4. McGregor has experience with 4oz gloves in UFC and responded to Mayweather's Instagram post with confidence, indicating his intention to aggressively pursue the fight. The NAC will publicly debate and announce their decision on the glove size before the fight.

5. The fight, which marks McGregor's boxing debut, has been criticized by some in the boxing community but was approved by Bennett after reviewing information that included McGregor's performance against Nate Diaz, his age and physical advantages over Mayweather, and input from boxing trainer Virgil Hunter.

6. Bennett observed that Mayweather has not had a knockout in ten years and considered McGregor's boxing skills, durability, and youth as factors in approving the fight. He has also monitored McGregor's training progress and advised his camp to hire a boxing referee, leading to the hiring of Joe Cortez, who reported an intense sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi.

"Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. ""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. ""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. ""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. ""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."" His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"". ""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. ""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,"" he says. ""The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards."" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. ""Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. ""But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. ""When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. ""Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. ""The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. ""At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. ""I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. ""He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'"" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the ""Stab in the Back"" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline. ""As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,"" says Mr Smith. ""It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.""","The passage details the historical significance of Fleet Street in London as a hub for British journalism and the recent closure of the Sunday Post's London office, marking the end of an era. Fleet Street was once the epicenter of the nation's newspaper industry, with the first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, published there in 1702. It was a prestigious location for journalists, with nearly every national paper having an office in the area. The street was known for its vibrant culture, including numerous bars and pubs where journalists would socialize and gather stories.

Two reporters, Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith, who worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, are highlighted as the last journalists working on Fleet Street. Sherriff, who spent 32 years there, recalls the smoke-filled newsrooms, typewriters, and the challenges of the old printing technology. Smith, based in Fleet Street for 25 years, shares anecdotes about the street's history, including its association with Sweeney Todd and the notorious El Vino wine bar.

The passage also mentions the decline of Fleet Street's dominance, initiated by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's relocation of his newspapers to Wapping in 1986, which led to a significant dispute and the eventual adoption of new printing technology by most national newspapers. This shift resulted in the transformation of the iconic Fleet Street buildings into various other businesses.

Former Sunday Express editor Robin Esser reflects on the importance of Fleet Street in an era before television and social media, when newspapers were the primary source of public information. Liz Hodgkinson, who worked in Fleet Street during the 70s and 80s, provides insight into the culture of heavy drinking and the challenges faced by women in the industry.

The closure of the Sunday Post's London office symbolizes the end of Fleet Street's role in British journalism. While Sherriff plans to write his memoirs, Smith will continue as a freelance journalist. The passage concludes by acknowledging the emotional significance of Fleet Street to those who worked there and its lasting impact on British history.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.48974,0.89319,0.969,1,1.0

"It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""","1.

The tweet, which questioned whether Elliott would discuss harassment and shootings he may have been involved in during his UDR service, was posted after Elliott's appearance on a BBC radio program in May 2014. The tweet was brought to Elliott's attention by victims campaigner Ann Travers and DUP assembly member Arlene Foster, who is set to become Northern Ireland's first minister.

Mrs. Blackburn, a lollipop lady for two decades and a mother of three, was on duty helping a woman and her child cross the road when Wright's VW Golf failed to stop at a red light and collided with her. Wright expressed deep remorse in court, acknowledging the devastating impact of his actions on Mrs. Blackburn and her family. The prosecutor, Sally Mealing-McLeod, stated that while other traffic had stopped, Wright's vehicle did not. Wright recalled being unable to see due to the sun and being in shock after hearing a bump. The trial is ongoing, with evidence presented about the position of the sun, which was close to setting and could have affected Wright's visibility. Mrs. Blackburn is currently receiving care in a residential facility.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.98975,0.89159,0.94179,1,1.0
"It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters. It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout."" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and ""fingerprinting"" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named ""Dynamic Mongoose"", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a ""key vulnerability"". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be ""exceptionally worried"" that it is seen as a ""soft touch"", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.","The passage describes a NATO naval exercise, ""Dynamic Mongoose,"" which is a response to increased Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic. The exercise involves the German U-boat U33 acting as an enemy submarine, with the objective of evading detection by NATO forces, including the USS Vicksburg and HMS Portland, to ""take out"" the command ship and an oil tanker. The difficulty of locating a submarine in the vast ocean is emphasized, with the task being compared to finding a needle in a haystack.

Rear Admiral Brad Williamson highlights the importance of the training in light of recent Russian submarine sightings near Sweden, Finland, and the UK. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, the anti-submarine warfare officer aboard the USS Vicksburg, acknowledges the challenge of detecting submarines that can remain hidden for extended periods.

The passage notes that while many European countries have reduced their defense spending, Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has significantly invested in its military, particularly its submarine fleet, which now includes around 60 submarines. Russia's recent launch of a submarine claimed to be the ""quietest in the world"" underscores the country's advancements in submarine technology.

Peter Roberts from the defense think tank RUSI describes Russia's submarines as highly advanced, with skilled crews, making them the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world."" These submarines can remain undetected for months and are capable of ""fingerprinting"" the vessels of other nations.

The exercise employs a range of assets to detect submarines, including anti-submarine warfare helicopters and, for the first time, underwater drones deployed by a NATO research vessel. These drones offer cost-effective, persistent surveillance and remove the need to put personnel in harm's way.

The passage also points out a significant gap in the UK's defenses: the absence of its own maritime patrol aircraft since the retirement of the Nimrod. This vulnerability means the UK relies on NATO allies for aerial surveillance against Russian submarines, which could potentially threaten the UK's nuclear deterrent.

In summary, the passage discusses a NATO exercise aimed at countering the growing threat of Russian submarines, highlighting the advanced capabilities of Russian submarines, the challenges of anti-submarine warfare, and the UK's vulnerability due to the lack of maritime patrol aircraft.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.97274,0.84579,0.9748,1,1.0
"United Nations officials rarely use the words ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing,"" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country. Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda. That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016. Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia. A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres. The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help. Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road. I asked him what they had left behind. ""They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,"" Mr Thomas told me. The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. ""They don't want us,"" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. ""These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them."" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.""We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,"" he said. ""It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed."" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. ""This has been unrelenting since July,"" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. ""The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides."" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in. As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit. Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem. ""War, war, war,"" she began, ""who are you and where do you come from?"" The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma. ""You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan."" There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people. Read more: 'I spent days hiding in a swamp' Artists paint for peace Uganda: 'One of the best places to be a refugee'","Since July, South Sudan has experienced a significant escalation of violence, leading to fears of genocide and ethnic cleansing. The unrest, which began in Juba, has since spread to the southern Equatoria states, causing over 340,000 people to flee to Uganda, making it the country with the highest number of refugees this year, surpassing even Syria. On average, 2,500 South Sudanese are becoming refugees daily, with harrowing tales of killings, rape, and ethnic targeting.

The border between South Sudan and Uganda is marked by small bridges or fallen trees, and refugees like Nelson Ladu Thomas have crossed into Uganda to escape the violence. Thomas described the atrocities committed by the Dinka tribe against other ethnic groups, including the Equatorians and Nuer. The conflict, initially a political dispute between President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, and former Vice-President Riek Machar, a Nuer, has evolved into widespread ethnic violence, particularly against Equatorians since July.

Refugees, such as Otima Amos, have endured dangerous journeys through the bush to reach safety, facing the threat of being killed or raped. Despite the influx, Uganda has managed the crisis effectively, providing land and resources for refugees to start anew. However, the country is beginning to feel the strain as it hosts nearly a million refugees.

The UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator, Nasir Abel Fernandes, has called for international attention and pressure on South Sudanese leaders to halt the civilian massacre. Water supply and the care of a large population of refugee children are significant challenges. Educational efforts continue despite the circumstances, with schools operating and students like Patricia Mercy expressing their experiences through art and poetry.

The situation in South Sudan has led to countless tragic stories, highlighting the severe impact on its people and the urgent need for a resolution to the conflict.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.75885,0.82705,0.97026,1,1.0

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

3. The collected evidence will be used to form recommendations for care providers and public bodies.
4. Rochira emphasizes the importance of hearing from older people and those who care for them, as their voices are central to her work.
5. She has observed both excellent care and concerning variations in care quality across Wales during her travels and interactions with older people in residential care.
6. The review will assess various aspects of residents' lives, including their physical and psychological health, social connections, and the care home environment.
7. In addition to speaking with residents and their families, the commissioner's team will engage with care providers, social care staff, and public bodies.
8. The goal of the review is to give a voice to older people and their families, ensuring that service providers understand the realities of living in residential care and take necessary actions to improve quality of life.
9. Mario Kreft, chair of Care Forum Wales, expresses support for the review's aims but notes disappointment that the main advisory panel lacks a provider expert with direct experience in managing or owning a care home.
10. Kreft suggests that the absence of such a representative on the panel is a missed opportunity for collaborative work and full engagement of the sector in the review process.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.95592,0.92798,0.98087,1,1.0

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term. Gloucester: Marshall; Sharples, Trinder, Twelvetrees, May; Burns, Heinz (capt); McAllister, Hibbard, Hohneck, Savage, Thrush, Moriarty, Rowan, Morgan.

The game was closely contested in the first half, with multiple lead changes. Alex Cuthbert scored two tries for the Blues, while Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scored for Gloucester. The scores were level several times, with penalties from Steven Shingler for the Blues and Billy Burns, followed by Billy Twelvetrees for Gloucester, keeping the match tight.

Gloucester's Josh Hohneck received a yellow card, during which the Blues scored 10 points to take a three-point lead into halftime, which they extended to six points early in the second half. However, Gloucester responded with four unanswered tries in the second half from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson, and Henry Purdy, securing a convincing victory.

The win marked Gloucester's progression to the next round where they will face La Rochelle, a team they had a mixed record against in the group stage. Gloucester had previously won the competition in 2015 but lost in the quarter-finals at home the following year.

"Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15. His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial. The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations. The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party. Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party. Police had initially said the vehicle reversed ""aggressively"" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.

"The president-elect has said Mrs Trump and Barron will move to Washington ""very soon, after he's finished with school"", but has not put an actual date on the move. But transition spokesman Jason Miller's insistence that the Trumps were ""energised and excited about their new role serving the country"" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media. ""First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world,"" wrote one Twitter user, Pamela Benbow. ""Melania Trump's decision is appalling."" Others joked it was Mrs Trump's taste in interiors which had prompted the decision, while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps' marriage. However, the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising. There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands' years as commander-in-chief: Martha Washington, because it had yet to be built, and Anna Harrison, because her husband died before she could take up residence. But Mrs Trump's decision has its supporters. ""Good, this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron's age,"" one Twitter user noted. However, it is not out of character for Mrs Trump, who has repeatedly stressed that Barron, 10, is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers. But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before? William Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season. The president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time. The first lady referred to the first home as ""Oak View"" but it was more commonly known as ""Red Top"" because of its red roof. But the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House. ""The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not,"" Mr Seale said. ""It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school. I don't find it very surprising."" Mr Seale noted that the children of President John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison's death, were not immediately moved to the White House. James Madison's wife, Dolley Madison, also sent her son from her first marriage, Payne Todd, away to school. There have been two sets of school age children living in the White House in the past three decades: Chelsea Clinton, who was 12 at the time, and Malia and Sasha Obama, who were 10 and seven respectively. They also had to move across the country when their fathers became president - but all three lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from the day of the inauguration. In fact, the Obamas avoided the problem of the girls having to change school mid-term by moving to Washington early, allowing them to start a new school a few weeks before Dad was inaugurated in January 2009. Read more: Why Obama may not go quietly Mrs Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority, with everything else coming second. Reading between the lines, it suggests she will not be taking on the full-time role predecessors like Mrs Obama have. Officially, the role of the first lady is only ceremonial - she is supposed to be the White House's hostess, organising and attending functions with or without their spouses. In more recent times, they have also sought out causes to support and promote. Mrs Obama has used her time backing a number of initiatives and projects, including Let Girls Learn, that aims to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school. The first lady occupies a very public role, according to Mr Seale. ""It gives a kind of personal side to the White House. It might even be considered vital to the public's perception of the president,"" he said. ""[The president] is an administrator and a he is a symbol and I think the first lady's role is very important to that symbol part."" Lou Henry Hoover, wife to President Herbert Hoover, was the first president's wife to really take on an active public role, Mr Seale said. Her immediate successor, Eleanor Roosevelt, also served as a more visible first lady in her husband's administration. One notable first lady who was reluctant to step into the public role was Nancy Reagan, according to Mr Seale. Mrs Reagan, who had a big influence on her husband's presidency and would later become known for her anti-drug campaign, was at first only focused on being a supportive wife. ""Her big interest in the world was her husband,"" Mr Seale said, adding that she was a very private person. As to what Melania's priorities will be there is only one hint - she is interested in tackling cyber-bullying. Read more: Taking to the streets for women's issues It has happened in the past. However, not when the president's wife has still been alive. Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph took the role in 1801, while Angelica van Buren took up the duties of a first lady after marrying President Martin van Buren's son in 1838. Both men had lost their wives almost 20 years earlier. However, could Ivanka Trump - described as her father's ""proxy wife"" by Vanity Fair during the election campaign - take up some of the responsibility from her step-mother? There is more recent precedent, too. Chelsea performed some of her mother's duties during the final days of her father's presidency, while Mrs Clinton concentrated on her own political career. The White House can be whatever the family makes it. Chelsea was known to do her homework in the Oval Office from time to time, while she also hosted sleepovers for friends - which could mean they found themselves sitting with the President the next morning, as Bill Clinton always tried to have breakfast with his daughter. Both Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama fit their duties as First Lady around their children, and both families asked for the press to respect their daughters' privacy - requests which were, on the whole, respected. The Obamas are also strict about putting time aside for the girls: family dinner takes place every night at 18:30. Mr Obama has said only a national emergency will stop him joining his family. ""The surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more 'normal' than it's ever been,"" the President said in an interview with US magazine More earlier this year. It is a response echoed by Chelsea about her own years. She told the Huffington Post: ""I was always deeply aware that I was living in history. But then I would have dinner with my parents at the kitchen table every night. There was so much about my life that also was normal.""","The passage discusses the decision of future First Lady Melania Trump to delay moving into the White House with her son Barron until he finishes his school year. This decision has sparked mixed reactions on social media, with some criticizing it as a departure from tradition, as only two other First Ladies have not resided in the White House during their husbands' presidencies. Others support Melania's choice, viewing it as a responsible parenting decision.

Historical context is provided by White House Historical Association historian William Seale, who notes that it is not uncommon for presidential children to finish their school year before moving, and that past presidents' children have also faced educational transitions. The passage also touches on the role of the First Lady, which is largely ceremonial but has evolved to include advocacy for various causes. Melania Trump has indicated that her focus will be on her son, suggesting a less public role than her predecessors.

The passage further explores the historical precedents for First Ladies who have been less visible or have had their duties performed by others, such as daughters or daughters-in-law. It also mentions the balance previous First Families have struck between public duties and private family life, emphasizing the importance of maintaining normalcy for children in the White House.

In summary, the passage covers Melania Trump's decision to postpone moving to the White House for her son's educational stability, the public's varied reactions to this choice, historical examples of how presidential families have managed similar situations, the evolving role of the First Lady, and the balance between public service and private family life in the White House.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.90682,0.79158,0.975,1,1.0

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year. Chinese Grand Prix race results Chinese Grand Prix coverage details","The Chinese Grand Prix was marked by a series of first-lap collisions that significantly impacted the race's outcome. Lewis Hamilton, the world champion, started from the back and suffered a broken front wing on the first lap, necessitating five pit stops. Despite these setbacks, he managed to fight his way through the field. However, he was eventually passed by Kimi Raikkonen, who had also been involved in a collision with his Ferrari teammate Sebastian Vettel. Raikkonen's use of soft tyres in the final stint gave him an advantage over Hamilton, who was on mediums.

Vettel, who finished second, had a contentious moment with Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat, accusing him of nearly causing a three-car collision. Kvyat, who finished third, defended his aggressive driving as a necessary risk to achieve a podium finish.

Nico Rosberg, who started from pole, had a relatively trouble-free race and maintained his lead throughout, eventually winning the Grand Prix. His victory extended his championship lead over Hamilton to 36 points after three races, a significant margin given that no driver who has won the first three races has failed to win the championship.

The race began with a chaotic first lap, leading to the safety car being deployed on lap four. By this point, both Hamilton and Raikkonen had already made unscheduled pit stops to repair damage to their front wings. Despite the early setbacks, Raikkonen managed to climb back to fifth place, while Hamilton's progress was hindered by damage to his car's suspension and aerodynamics, leaving him with an uphill battle to catch Rosberg in the championship standings.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.56838,0.33882,0.50938,1,1.0

Zwanziger admitted that football was ""now as ever a hard business, where unfortunately an open discourse about homosexuality is still not taken for granted"". Current Germany captain Philipp Lahm created controversy in 2011 when he wrote in his autobiography that he would encourage gay footballers to keep quiet about their sexuality. ""I would not encourage any gay professional footballer to come out,"" he wrote at the time. ""I would fear that he would end up like Justin Fashanu [the English footballer who killed himself after revealing that he was gay]."" The last German footballer to come out was second tier player Marcus Urban, who told Die Welt in 2007 that he knew of at least three gay footballers in the Bundesliga who were too scared to reveal their sexuality. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert praised Hitzlsperger for going public. ""It's good that he's spoken about something which is important to him,"" Seibert told a media briefing. ""We live in a country where nobody should be worried about making his sexuality known or concerned about intolerance. ""We judge footballers on whether they have behaved well and worthily on and off the pitch and I believe that both are the case with Mr Hitzlsperger."" Openly Gay German politician Volker Beck said he hoped Hitzlsperger's announcement would encourage others to do the same. ""I hope that Hitzlsperger's courageous step contributes to finally breaking down this taboo,"" he said. ""It's now the job of the German FA to embolden active players [to do the same]."" And Zwanziger said he was optimistic that Hitzlsperger's announcement would lead to greater openness about sexuality in German football. He said: ""I'm confident that sexual orientations will soon not be an issue in football at all.""","Thomas Hitzlsperger, a former German footballer, publicly revealed his homosexuality in an interview with Die Zeit, aiming to foster discussion on a topic he felt was overlooked in German football.

They praised his courage and saw his disclosure as an important step in the fight against homophobia and a significant moment for German society. Hitzlsperger's bravery was also acknowledged by international figures such as Gary Lineker and John Amaechi. Bayern Munich, where Hitzlsperger began his career, also expressed support.

Zwanziger noted that an open discourse about homosexuality was still not commonplace in the sport.

Marcus Urban, a former second-tier player, had also spoken out about the fear of coming out in the Bundesliga. Hitzlsperger's revelation was seen as a potential catalyst for change, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman and openly gay politician Volker Beck expressing hope that it would encourage others to be open about their sexuality.

"Mr Schmidt told the BBC that the company did what was ""legally required"" to pay the right amount of taxes. Google paid Â£10m in UK corporate taxes between 2006 and 2011. Mr Schmidt said it was up to the government to change its tax system if it wanted companies to pay more taxes. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week, he said: ""What we are doing is legal. I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional. ""I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate. You pay the taxes. ""If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less. That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom."" Meanwhile, the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms. She told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret, meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules. Google, most of whose UK sales are routed through Ireland, is one of the multinationals strongly criticised for organising their tax affairs in ways that minimise the amounts they pay in the UK. Last week, European Union leaders agreed to tackle tax avoidance through an ""automatic information exchange between tax authorities"" to monitor the situation. The Google chairman has previously argued that corporate taxes should be levied in the country where it conducts economic activity and takes risks, rather than where products are consumed. He has also called for a debate on international tax reform.

"The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: ""The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.""","1. NHS Improvement is pushing for greater progress in reducing the NHS's agency staff bill, which was £3.6bn last year, with a target to cut costs by £1bn by the end of the financial year.
2. A cap introduced in October has saved £600m so far by limiting payments to no more than 55% above the standard rate for all staff except senior managers.
3. The initiative aims to lower the overall cost of agency staff and reduce NHS dependence on them, as they are more expensive due to agency fees and additional employer costs.
4. Despite the savings, the NHS is still not on track to meet its target, with trusts being 10% behind where they aim to be, and there is uncertainty about whether spending on other pay bill aspects has increased.
5. The figures from NHS Improvement do not include spending on NHS ""bank"" staff or overtime for employed staff.
6. NHS Improvement plans to publish league tables of trusts' agency spending performance and collect data on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust to address concerns about excessive earnings.
7. There have been instances of hospitals being quoted double the capped rates for doctors, indicating ongoing issues with agency pricing.
8. NHS Improvement's chief executive, Jim Mackey, emphasizes the need for further cost reductions, stating that the NHS cannot afford the high costs associated with agency staff.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.89101,0.94046,0.97722,1,1.0
"All glass and concrete beside a fast-flowing stream, the Longford Town Centre was to be a cathedral of commerce - now it stands as a monument to the end of the Celtic Tiger and the Republic of Ireland's economic crash and burn. But local traders believe the bad times are slowly changing. Matt O'Brien runs a family-owned men's clothing shop in the town centre. Recent years have been bad - 30% down on the boom - with a member of staff having to be laid off. But he can now see a turnaround. ""Over the last year we've noticed that business has increased, although it was coming from a low base, but we have improved,"" he says. ""We've done extra things to try to improve things. We've got into childrenswear and we do a very substantial dress-hire business. We've branched out into other areas, which have helped us."" Fianna FÃ¡il, the main opposition party, is highly critical of how the Fine Gael-Labour coalition is dealing with the midlands, arguing that the half-a-billion euro investment in water meters that won't be operational for several years should instead be spent on broadband improvement. Its local TD Robert Troy accuses the government of negligence and says a targeted approach is needed for the area. ""The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) haven't brought one potential client to Longford in over four years,"" he says. ""And if the IDA, which is charged with bringing foreign direct investment to the regions, isn't marketing Longford, isn't showing Longford to potential clients, how then can we expect foreign direct investment to come to Longford?"" But the government says it is doing its bit for County Longford, with the recent announcement that holiday company Center Parcs hopes to employ about 1,000 people at its planned tourism development in Ballymahon in the county when it opens in 2019. However, the proposed 200m euro (Â£146m) centre in 340 acres of wooded area still has to get planning permission. Nevertheless, James Bannon, the local Fine Gael TD, is confident the venture will be a success. He says: ""The midlands has some of the finest scenery and watersports that you could avail of anywhere in the world. ""You have the Shannon, just three miles from here you have the River Inny, you have the Royal Canal, you have huge infrastructure here and we're always open for new tourists to come in to this area."" The Center Parcs announcement will not harm the government's chances in next year's expected general election, but traders like Matt O'Brien believe more could be done to boost local business. ""At the moment a lot of people are unhappy at paying for parking on the street,"" he says. ""Some of our neighbouring towns don't have parking charges. There are issues with the council and if we had free parking it would help bring more people into the town."" So, the message coming from the midlands is that while it, too, is starting to see the beginnings of an economic recovery more still needs to be done.","1. The Longford Town Centre, once envisioned as a bustling commercial hub, now symbolizes the economic downturn in the Republic of Ireland following the Celtic Tiger era.
2. Local businesses, such as Matt O'Brien's family-owned men's clothing shop, have experienced significant declines in sales, leading to staff reductions, but are beginning to notice a gradual upturn in business.
3. O'Brien's shop has adapted by expanding into childrenswear and dress hire to improve business.
4. The main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, criticizes the current Fine Gael-Labour coalition's economic strategies for the midlands, advocating for investment in broadband over water meters and calling for a more targeted approach to economic development.
5. Fianna Fáil's local TD Robert Troy points out the lack of effort by the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) to attract foreign direct investment to Longford.
6. The government highlights its role in economic revival by announcing the potential creation of 1,000 jobs through the Center Parcs holiday resort development in Ballymahon, subject to planning permission.
7. Local Fine Gael TD James Bannon is optimistic about the Center Parcs project and the tourism potential of the midlands, citing its natural resources and infrastructure.
8. Despite the positive news, local traders like O'Brien believe that more could be done to support local businesses, such as eliminating street parking charges to attract more visitors to the town.
9. The overall sentiment in the midlands is one of cautious optimism, recognizing the early signs of economic recovery while emphasizing the need for continued efforts to bolster the local economy.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.63697,0.83509,0.95876,1,1.0

""I would like somebody to take the case on who's not frightened of the companies."" An EnQuest spokesperson said: ""EnQuest can confirm that, in December 2016, during planned shutdown activities on its Thistle platform, six personnel employed by Wood Group under a contract with EnQuest were removing a piece of pipework when they were exposed to low levels of NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material). ""The level of exposure was less than 1% of the level at which it is reportable to the Health and Safety Executive however EnQuest advised the HSE of the matter at the time. ""EnQuest has appropriate control measures in place which are designed to prevent exposure to NORM.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"".

At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely. On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.","1.

Simpson, who has also made the prize longlist on three other occasions, said finally winning was ""very nice indeed"". Judge Ansel Krut said Squint (19) was ""quite extraordinary"", even though it was a ""difficult painting to look at"". The work depicts a leper squint, which Simpson said were ""holes made in the sides of medieval churches so the undesirables could look through to the service and somehow take part"". He said it was one of a series of paintings he has been working on, some of which were ""much bigger"". The relatively small size of Squint (19) - which is about 7ft (2.1m) in height - was one of the reasons Simpson entered it into the competition, though he also admitted that it ""seemed to be a good idea to send one that I was conversant with and was working with"". He said the prize money would be spent on ""stretches, canvas and - particularly - good quality paints"". ""I spend a lot of money on materials, so this money is going to go to a good cause.""

The band he joined was disco group Heatwave, and his songs like Boogie Nights, Always & Forever and Groove Line became big hits for the band in the 1970s. By the time he left the band in 1978, his tunes had caught the attention of producer Quincy Jones, who was looking for songwriters for a new Michael Jackson LP. Temperton penned three songs for Off The Wall, which became Jackson's breakthrough solo album - the title track, Rock With You and Burn This Disco Out. He went on to write three more for follow-up Thriller - the title track, which became one of Jackson's signature smashes, plus Baby Be Mine and The Lady in My Life. They helped make Thriller the best-selling album of all time in the US, with 32 million copies sold. His tunes have also been recorded by artists including Anita Baker, Donna Summer, Aretha Franklin and The Brothers Johnson. Temperton won a Grammy Award in 1990 for his work on Birdland, from Quincy Jones's album Back on the Block. He was nominated for two Oscars in 1986 for his work with Jones on the soundtrack for The Color Purple.

Their research investigated ditched enclosures which were concealed for centuries by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation allowed the discovery of more than 450 large geometrical ""geoglyphs"". The team said the function of these mysterious sites is still little understood. They are unlikely to be villages, since archaeologists have recovered very few artefacts during excavation, and their layout does not suggest they were built for defensive reasons. Instead it is thought they were used only sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America, or Britain's own Stonehenge. Although Dr Loader - who has analysed soil samples from the geoglyphs - said the surroundings in which they were built were very different to other ritual sites around the world. He looked at phytoliths - a type of microscopic plant fossil made of silica - to reconstruct ancient vegetation; charcoal quantities, to assess the amount of ancient forest burning; and carbon stable isotopes, to indicate the type of vegetation growing there in the past. ""The indications are that the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation. So, unlike the towering Maya pyramids of Central America, they were likely not visible above the forest canopy, and this raises questions about their purpose,"" he explained. It had been assumed prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th Century, the Amazonian forests had been pristine ecosystems, free from human influence. But the new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years, which could only have been artificially brought together by humans. It suggested instead of burning large tracts of forest - either for geoglyph construction or agricultural practices - people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms. The team have likened it to a form of ""prehistoric supermarket"" of useful forest products. They said there is ""tantalizing evidence"" to suggest the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient ""agroforestry"" practices to this day.","A team of researchers, including Dr Neil Loader and Emeritus Prof Alayne Street-Perrott from Swansea University, have discovered ancient earthworks in Acre state in the western Brazilian Amazon. These earthworks, which could be around 2,000 years old, consist of more than 450 large geometrical ""geoglyphs"" that were hidden by bamboo-dominated rainforest until recent deforestation revealed them. The team, which also includes experts from the universities of Exeter and Reading, and Brazil's São Paulo and Belém, has been studying these enclosures.

The purpose of these geoglyphs remains largely unknown. They do not appear to have been permanent settlements or defensive structures, as few artifacts have been found and their layout is not indicative of such uses. Instead, it is speculated that they were used intermittently, possibly for rituals, similar to Maya pyramids or Stonehenge. Dr Loader's analysis of soil samples from the sites suggests that the geoglyphs were built in areas with taller vegetation, unlike the visible Maya pyramids, which raises questions about their visibility and purpose.

The research challenges the previous belief that the Amazonian forests were untouched by humans before the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century. Evidence indicates that over 6,000 years, humans introduced a variety of plant species, suggesting that the region was subject to ancient ""agroforestry"" practices. Rather than clearing large areas of forest, people seem to have focused on cultivating economically valuable trees, creating a ""prehistoric supermarket"" of forest products. The team suggests that the biodiversity in some of Acre's remaining forests may be a legacy of these ancient practices.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.97586,0.94894,0.9827,1,1.0

On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell. Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson. The teenager wrote on his page: ""I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again. ""I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving. ""Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile."" At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity.

"After a drab game with few chances for either side, Mohamed Salah teed up El Said, who struck firmly past Uganda keeper Denis Onyango on 89 minutes. Uganda's Joseph Ochaya earlier had a goal correctly disallowed for offside. The win means Egypt play Ghana on Wednesday with top spot of Group D still at stake, while Uganda are out of their first tournament since 1978. Ghana secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 victory over Mali earlier on Saturday. On a deteriorating pitch in Port-Gentil, seven-times champions Egypt failed to break down a resolute Cranes defence for long periods. Onyango made an impressive clearing header to deny the onrushing Salah at the end of an otherwise lifeless first half. Uganda began the second half brightly, forcing veteran Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary to punch several set-pieces clear but ultimately failed to register a shot on target as Ochaya turned in Faruku Miya's through ball from a clearly offside position on 52 minutes. El Said blasted a shot well over when unmarked and Marwan Mohsen went close for the Pharaohs with a header, but Egypt appeared to be heading for their second consecutive goalless draw. However, an otherwise quiet Salah showed great composure late on to check his shot and play in El Said with a reverse pass, the substitute's close-range shot evading Onyango.

"Women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise - but are less likely to get one, the research found. The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers. It found ""no support"" for the ""reticent female"" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money. For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females. When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found. The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications. The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings. ""The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this."" He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women ""were more straightforward and tell their friends"". ""Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,"" Prof Oswald added. ""It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely."" The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change. Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: ""The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.""","The study conducted by Cass Business School, the University of Warwick, and the University of Wisconsin, involving 4,600 workers, found that women are equally likely to request a pay raise as men but are 25% less likely to receive one when they do ask. This finding contradicts the ""reticent female"" theory, which suggests that women are less inclined to ask for more money. The study specifically compared full-time males to full-time females and part-time males to part-time females to eliminate wage disparities based on working hours. It also considered factors such as employer size, industry, parental status, and qualifications. The data used for the analysis came from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey, which uniquely records whether employees requested a pay increase and their reasons for doing so or not. The findings suggest that the discrepancy in pay raise success rates between men and women may be due to discrimination rather than women's reluctance to ask. The study also noted that younger women under 40 are negotiating pay and conditions as successfully as their male counterparts, indicating a potential shift in negotiation behavior in the younger workforce.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.58939,0.89899,0.91107,1,1.0

"The incident began on Tuesday morning when border agents encountered two men carrying backpacks five miles (8km) east of Sumas, Washington, in the US. Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA, or ecstasy, from Canada to San Francisco. Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs. On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said. One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday. The officers took the other man, identified as Jeffrey Laviolette, into custody immediately. Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter, putting up road blocks. Nathan Hall, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Abbotsford Police Department in British Columbia early on Wednesday morning. According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr Hall and Mr Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb (26kg) of ecstasy. Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William Nickerson but a picture of Nathan Hall, the complaint alleges. Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (Â£7,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco. Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint. The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges. The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are ""a large part of our practice"".","The passage describes an incident involving an attempt to smuggle MDMA (ecstasy) from Canada into the United States.

"The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had ""ironclad information"" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and ""pushed hard"" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was ""just not true"", but he hoped the resolution would ""serve as a wake-up call"" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements ""has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace"". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. ""It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,"" he said. ""We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict."" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as ""misleading critiques"" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution ""paves the way"" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. ""We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,"" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.","1. The passage describes the aftermath of the US abstaining from a UN Security Council vote on a resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlement construction, which was seen as a significant shift in US policy and infuriated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
2. Netanyahu accused the Obama administration of helping draft the resolution and pushing for its passage, which the US State Department denied.
3. The resolution, which passed on December 23, 2016, declared that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have no legal validity, are in violation of international law, and are obstacles to peace and the two-state solution.
4. Israel, which disputes the illegality of the settlements, rejected the resolution and took diplomatic actions in response, such as summoning ambassadors, recalling its own ambassadors from New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and canceling a visit by the Ukrainian prime minister.
5. A planned vote on authorizing new housing units in the settlements was postponed at the request of Netanyahu's office to avoid further tension with the US ahead of a speech by US Secretary of State John Kerry on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

"He was speaking in a BBC interview in which he paid tribute to the Queen on the eve of her 90th birthday. She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday.

The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"".

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park. The fourth-tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday, but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian. Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross.

"Imran Khawaja tried to sneak back into the UK last year - and while his exact activity in Syria remains a mystery, police say he is one of the most dangerous British jihadists to return from conflict. He was one of the most public British fighters in Syria - always online, but always masked. But now, Imran Khawaja, 27, from Southall, west London is facing a possible prison term up to life imprisonment for his role in life and death on Syria's battlefields. Khawaja left the UK last January. He called himself Abu Daigham al-Britani. And after reaching the warzone via Kurdish territory, he began posting videos and pictures of his personal jihad. In one video he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side - but ""thanks to Allah's will"" was soon back on the front line. In another - masked again - he is showing off his amateur weight-lifting skills as his brothers-in-arms cheer him on. Khawaja was a member of Rayat al Tawheed - which means Flag of Unity. The group of fighters affiliated to Islamic State includes many British men, and they have spent more than a year selling a message to their supporters and would-be recruits back home. Khawaja was involved in appeals for donations, video diaries of their lives  and ""through the keyhole"" tours of fighters' quarters. Shiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR), at Kings College London, has been tracking foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. He says: ""The group that Khawaja was with in Syria was really quite dynamic,"" he says. ""They clearly had people with programming skills - they were able to put together very slick, well produced propaganda videos and posters that appealed to young British Muslims. ""They were able to play on the same cultural anchors and mores that those people recognised and know. They could speak to them as peers. ""Rayat al Tawheed helped a great deal in the early stages of this conflict with portraying the idea of volunteering as a jihadist as quite a glamorous adventurous thing - and a noble thing."" But Rayat's war was neither noble nor glamorous. Some of its material online showed gruesome scenes of death. One image showed a man's bloodied-hands with the caption ""my first time"". And another shocking image included Imran Khawaja. In this gruesome picture, the Londoner - masked yet again - is holding a bag that contains a head. The only thing we know about the victim is that he was supposedly a Syrian army soldier. But we do know that the British security service MI5 was watching - and waiting. And last June, its opportunity came. Imran Khawaja decided to come home. It's not clear why because he hasn't told the police. His cousin Tahir Bhatti, a taxi driver from Watford, agreed to help him return because the family wanted him back safely. Khawaja's own intentions are unclear. He had originally asked his cousin for money for a new gun - something Bhatti did not help him with. And then the fighter began trying to cover his tracks. As Bhatti, who has admitted assisting an offender, drove to Bulgaria to pick him up, Khawaja faked his own death with an online obituary that said he had died in battle. The announcement asked that Allah grant him the highest position in heaven. He then tried to slip back into Britain unnoticed. As the pair arrived at Dover, the police were waiting - and they ended up facing prosecution at the Old Bailey. Cdr Richard Walton, the head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command, says: ""Imran Khawaja is not a vulnerable teenager who has been enticed to travel to Syria. ""This is a man who chosen the path of terrorism, who has chosen to go out to Syria to be trained and engage in a terrorist training camp. ""We don't know why he came back, we don't know what he was planning - but we know he concealed his entry and faked his own death. This is a dangerous man."" Imran Khawaja was considered so dangerous that while he was on remand, he was held in the special unit for high risk terrorism suspects at London's maximum security Belmarsh prison. He has admitted four offences: Tahir Bhatti has pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. Khawaja had originally faced an additional charge of soliciting to murder. That allegation, the most serious to be made yet against a Syrian fighter, will lie on file.","Imran Khawaja, a 27-year-old from Southall, west London, is facing a potential life sentence for his activities as a jihadist in Syria. He left the UK in January of the previous year and became known as Abu Daigham al-Britani, actively posting videos and images of his experiences on the battlefield. Khawaja was a member of Rayat al Tawheed, a group affiliated with Islamic State, which produced slick propaganda to recruit young British Muslims. Despite the group's portrayal of jihad as glamorous and noble, their online content also included disturbing images of violence, including one of Khawaja holding a bag with a severed head.

Upon his return to the UK, Khawaja attempted to conceal his entry and even faked his own death online. His cousin, Tahir Bhatti, assisted him in his return, for which Bhatti has admitted to assisting an offender. The British security service MI5 was monitoring Khawaja, and he was arrested upon arrival at Dover. Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command described Khawaja as a dangerous individual who had chosen the path of terrorism and had been held in a special unit at Belmarsh prison. Khawaja has pleaded guilty to four offences, while the charge of soliciting to murder will remain on file.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.77291,0.92053,0.96224,1,1.0

"Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to ""concede everything"", and the opposition's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith, responded that his party was giving people ""false hope"". The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal. But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. ""It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,"" the source said. For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of ""waving through the government's plans"" and ""lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit"". It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing.

"Yet in this election, it is way down the list of priorities for most political parties. Philip Hammond, himself a former defence secretary, has been reported as saying recently that ""there are no votes in defence"". He does not recognise the quote, but the sentiment is largely borne out by the opinion polls which show defence just scrapes into the top 10 of electorate concerns, way behind the economy, the NHS and immigration. UK military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya may have also contributed to a sense of combat fatigue among the public and a reticence by politicians to focus on the subject. James de Waal, a senior fellow at independent think tank Chatham House, says in this campaign, politicians have been ""on the defensive on defence"". This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK’s defence forces at home and abroad. Policy guide: Where the parties stand To find out Labour and Conservative policies on the subject you will have to persevere to page 77 of both their manifestos. Even then they are pretty short on detail and do not really address the difficult decisions the next government is likely to face. So to help, here is a guide to some of the more sensitive issues being left out. Most analysts, and politicians, agree the world is becoming more dangerous and unstable, whether that is shown by thousands of migrants fleeing so-called failed states, the threat from Islamic extremism, or a more belligerent Russia. Yet at the same time, most European nations, including the UK, have been making significant cuts to their armed forces. The size of the UK's regular Army is being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000. You could fit that number in Wembley Stadium and still have seats to spare. The Royal Navy now has a fleet of just 19 warships, while the RAF has been left with eight - soon to be seven - front-line fast jet squadrons. There are some things the UK military can no longer do - so-called capability gaps. The UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft. It has to rely on its Nato allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters. At the start of the last parliament, David Cameron could boast that the UK was the fourth biggest spender on defence in the world. Now, according to the Stockholm International Research Institute, the UK has fallen to sixth place, behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and France. A commitment to spend 2% of the nation's wealth, or GDP, on defence is conspicuous by its absence. Only two smaller parties - UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party - say they would continue to meet that goal. But all the indications suggest the UK will soon fall below the Nato threshold. Malcolm Chalmers, of the defence think tank Royal United Services Institute, says on current projections, UK defence spending will fall to 1.7% by the end of the decade. If there are more cuts it could fall to 1.5%. He calculates that defence would require another £25bn over the next five years to stay above 2%. The military top brass know that is not going to happen. Their planning assumptions are based on flat spending plus an annual increase of 1% in the equipment budget. Spending 2% is not mandatory to Nato membership. Few states do, but it is totemic. The US will inevitably think less of a key ally that no longer lives up to that commitment, especially when David Cameron recently lectured others on the need to increase defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales. In US eyes, the UK's credibility will inevitably suffer if, as seems likely, it fails to meet the 2% target. It is more than likely that any future government will have to make more cuts in defence. The question is by how much? Over the lifetime of the last parliament, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) cut its budget by about 8%. With the Conservatives, Labour, and the Lib Dems promising to bring down the budget deficit, there will have to be more savings in public spending. None of these three parties say they would ring-fence or protect defence, like the NHS or overseas aid. The MoD has reason to be nervous - it has the second largest non-protected budget, after welfare, of £34bn a year. Another Conservative-led government plans to make savings of around £12bn a year. Shared across the board that could mean the MoD losing at least another  £2bn-£3bn of its annual budget. But Michael Clark, director of defence think tank Rusi, says most of the political parties appear to be backing away from further big cuts, in part because UKIP has made defence an issue during the campaign. The Conservatives also appear to have limited their options. They are promising to replace Trident, to increase the defence equipment budget by 1% a year, and to make no further cuts to the size of the regular army. Mr Clark says those commitments will make it hard to find ""significant savings"" in defence. But without raiding the MoD's coffers, he says, the Conservatives' entire fiscal plans would ""go out of the window"". Labour has been careful to avoid making similar commitments. Military chiefs, though, are still worried. Gen Sir Richard Shirreff, who was the second most senior military commander at Nato, says: "" I fear it's almost certain that there will be more cuts."" The Conservatives and UKIP are committed to renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent with a like-for-like replacement. That means building four new submarines at an estimated cost of at least £20bn. According to the MoD's own figures, about one quarter of committed defence equipment spending over the next decade will be on the successor submarines and deterrent systems. So it is an obvious area to look for savings. Labour say they would continue the round-the-clock patrols, known as Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), but will look at whether that can be done with three rather than four submarines. The Liberal Democrats say they would retain a nuclear deterrent, but end CASD - what has been dubbed a ""part-time deterrent"". The SNP and the Greens would scrap it altogether. There is no political consensus. James de Waal, who worked in the MoD on the last Strategic Defence Review says: ""Trident might be up for grabs."" It is worth remembering the Tories went into the last election committed to renewing Trident, but as part of the coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats, postponed the decision. What is to prevent another review and another delay, especially if a party like the SNP holds the balance of power? Paul Ingram, who heads the British American Security Information Council, says the nuclear programme will have to be included in the next Strategic Defence Review, due after the election. Not least because he says the US will find it hard to stomach a key ally spending all that money on the nuclear programme, if it means contemplating further cuts to the UK's conventional forces. By the end of this decade, after a gap of 10 years, the UK will have two new operational aircraft carriers. The Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. They should be a symbol of power and of global ambition. But there is a danger that they will be more like the emperor's new clothes. On current manning levels, the Royal Navy will struggle to crew both carriers, even if as planned only one of them is operational at any given time. Plans to equip them with the new F-35 jet, have already had to be scaled down. There is space on board for 36 F-35s, but current plans are to sail with just 12. The current chief of the defence staff, Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton, has already warned of the dangers of a ""hollow force"" with ""exquisite equipment"" but not enough people. Politicians have long boasted that in military terms Britain can punch above its weight on the world stage. But it's becoming harder to live up to that rhetoric.","1. Defence is a low priority in the current election, ranking outside the top electorate concerns such as the economy, NHS, and immigration. This is partly due to public combat fatigue from UK military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya.
2. Both the Labour and Conservative parties have brief mentions of their defence policies on page 77 of their manifestos, lacking detail and avoiding tough decisions.
3. Despite a perceived increase in global instability and threats, European nations, including the UK, have cut their military forces. The UK Army is reducing to 82,000, the Navy has 19 warships, and the RAF will soon have seven fast jet squadrons, indicating capability gaps.
4. The UK has fallen from fourth to sixth in global defence spending, and current projections suggest it may fall below the NATO threshold of spending 2% of GDP on defence, potentially impacting its credibility with allies like the US.
5. None of the major parties plan to ring-fence defence spending, meaning further cuts are likely, with the MoD's £34bn budget at risk. The Conservatives have made some defence commitments that may limit their ability to make significant savings.
6. The future of the UK's nuclear deterrent, Trident, is uncertain, with the Conservatives and UKIP supporting a like-for-like replacement, Labour considering a reduced submarine fleet, the Liberal Democrats advocating for a part-time deterrent, and the SNP and Greens wanting to scrap it entirely.
7. The UK will have two new aircraft carriers by the end of the decade, but there are concerns about crewing and equipping them adequately, highlighting the risk of a ""hollow force"" with insufficient personnel and resources.
8. The next Strategic Defence Review will need to address these issues, including the nuclear programme's impact on conventional forces, and how to maintain the UK's military influence on the world stage.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.6548,0.83173,0.96599,1,1.0

"Many women have questioned the safety of the implants, which are used to treat incontinence, after suffering debilitating side effects. Two patients sitting on the original review group quit in protest at what they said was a watered-down report. Now independent expert Alison Britton, a professor of healthcare and medical law, will examine the final report. Ms Robison told Holyrood's public petitions committee that Prof Britton, from Glasgow Caledonian University, would examine the process by which the report came to its conclusions. She told MSPs: ""Professor Britton will produce a report on how the independent review process was undertaken and importantly what lessons can be learned in the future."" The report concluded procedures should not be offered routinely to women with pelvic organ prolapse. It recommended patients  be offered a range of treatments and given the information to make ""informed choices"". The report also said reporting of adverse events should be mandatory. Ms Robison confirmed the recommendations would continue to be implemented despite calls from campaigners for an all-out ban. The health secretary said the government did not have the power to ban the procedures as that lay with UK regulatory body the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. In other evidence, the chairwoman of the independent review Tracey Gillies apologised for failing to unite all panel members around the review's controversial final report. Ms Gillies took over as chairwoman of the independent review of transvaginal mesh implants in its final stages towards the end of last year. It emerged she had no conversations with previous chairwoman Lesley Wilkie, who resigned for personal reasons. Her evidence was punctuated by cries of ""shame on you"" and ""rubbish"" from a packed public gallery which included some women who had suffered painful and debilitating complications as a result of the procedure. Ms Gillies said her task had been ""almost mission impossible from the beginning"". She said: ""It was clear that there were strongly-held views of difference at the point that I came in, so one could say more fool me for agreeing to chair this. ""This is not something that most people would have ... welcomed would be the wrong word, but it's clearly going to be a very difficult thing and I personally have reflected and feel disappointed that I have not achieved what I would have set out to do, which would have been to bring this in in consensus.

"Muir, 23, broke McColgan's 25-year-old record by 14 seconds at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow on Wednesday, with a time of 14 minutes, 49.12 seconds. McColgan said she felt excited to see her last record broken by Muir. She had earlier raised concerns about whether Muir's race had met all the criteria set by UK Athletics for record-breaking attempts. She had told BBC radio's John Beattie programme it needed to be a ""genuine race"" and may not have been as ""Muir had been the only competitor"". ""It was a mixed 3K race where all the other girls ran 3K and it was only Laura who finished the 5K,"" she said. ""We were wondering if to get a record ratified you have to have drug testing as well. ""So we were just wondering if they had everything in place to actually have it ratified as a record."" However, British Athletics confirmed Muir's time was expected to be classified as official. A spokesman said: ""The time will undergo ratification but is expected to be confirmed"". Rules stipulate that if there is no doping control at an event where a British record is set, there is no requirement for the athlete to submit drug tests. McColgan said Muir had what it took to win world medals. ""To run 14.49 indoors is pretty good,"" she said. ""But she is a 3.55 minute 1,500m runner, so you would expect someone like Laura to run (5K) in something like 14.30. ""So there's still a lot more in the tank and I don't think that's the fastest 5K she's ever going to run. ""She's got the ability to get down to 14.30, which is really mixing it with the top in the world."" McColgan said Muir's race, which saw her lap other runners, had been similar to her own record-breaking race 25 years ago. ""I ran on my own right from the start with nobody really pushing me at all,"" she said. ""I actually lapped a young Paula Radcliffe about two or three times."" McColgan said it was a bonus that her record was beaten by a fellow Scot. ""She is world class,"" she said. ""She just needs to get her race tactics right so that she can start winning some medals."" Muir broke her own British 1500m record at the Diamond League meeting in Paris in August and reached the 1,500m Olympic final at Rio 2016.","23-year-old Laura Muir broke the 25-year-old 5000m indoor British record previously held by Liz McColgan, finishing with a time of 14 minutes, 49.12 seconds at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow. McColgan expressed excitement about the record being broken and acknowledged Muir's potential to win world medals. Despite initial concerns raised by McColgan regarding the legitimacy of the race as a ""genuine"" record-breaking attempt, since Muir was the only competitor finishing the 5000m distance, British Athletics confirmed that Muir's time was expected to be officially recognized. McColgan also noted that Muir, who is a 3.55 minute 1500m runner, has the potential to run even faster, possibly around 14.30 for the 5000m. McColgan drew parallels between Muir's race and her own record-breaking run 25 years ago, where she also lapped other runners, including a young Paula Radcliffe. She praised Muir as world-class and emphasized the importance of race tactics for Muir to win medals at the world level.

The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. ""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday.

Ulster Unionists want the election to be a referendum on how the Renewable Heat Incentive debacle was handled. But the focus has now turned on them following Mr Nesbitt's comments. Mr Nesbitt was asked about the decision of his senior party colleague Danny Kennedy to publicly distance himself from the remarks. He turned to Mr Kennedy, who was sitting behind him on the platform, and said: ""It wasn't disappointing, it was actually quite reaffirming to know Danny was listening.""

However, Nesbitt's own comments have become a focal point, particularly after his colleague Danny Kennedy distanced himself from them. Nesbitt responded positively to Kennedy's action, seeing it as a sign of active listening.

During the event, Nesbitt faced questions about his remarks and whether he had any regrets. He maintained his stance, advocating for voters to support UUP candidates and then choose any candidate they believe will act in the best interest of their community and country. He expressed a preference for forming a government with the SDLP over Sinn Féin and reported positive feedback while canvassing in unionist areas.

"Met Police barrister Richard Horwell QC said suspects Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi had no personal motive to kill. The Russian state ""is likely to have been the sponsor of this plot"" and had ""reasons aplenty"" for wishing him ""not only harm, but death"", he said. UK officials believe the two suspects poisoned Mr Litvinenko, 43, in London in 2006 but they deny any wrongdoing. Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive substance polonium-210 during a meeting with Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi. He died in hospital nearly three weeks later. The fact that polonium caused his death indicates there was some form of Russian state participation, Mr Horwell said in his closing remarks. He said: ""The evidence suggests the only credible explanation is that in one form or another the Russian state was involved in Mr Litvinenko's murder."" However, he stressed this did not mean Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved or gave the order and that there were many possible motives for the murder. Defecting to the UK in 2000, after accusing KGB successor the FSB of murdering political opponents and of corruption, could have been seen as ""akin to treachery"", he said. He also spoke of Mr Litvinenko's ""many personal attacks on Putin"". Mr Horwell has said the risk to the general public in London from polonium radiation will never be known, and also that Mr Litvinenko had been poisoned twice in the run-up to his death. He said: ""The two attacks on Mr Litvinenko were an outrage. They led to great suffering on his part and eventually to his demise. ""We will never know how dangerous the exposure of polonium to the public at large will be and what long-term effects will be visited upon Londoners."" Mr Horwell said the suspects left a ""trail of polonium"" behind and they had ""no credible answer"" to the scientific evidence against them. While the force wanted them tried for murder, this was now unlikely to happen, the inquiry heard. Attempts to extradite the two men have failed and they remain in Russia. Former Soviet army officer Mr Kovtun has been criticised by inquiry chairman Sir Robert Owen for failing to give evidence to the hearing. The inquiry was adjourned until Friday.","The passage describes the findings and conclusions presented by Met Police barrister Richard Horwell QC regarding the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. Horwell asserts that the suspects, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi, had no personal motive to kill Litvinenko and suggests that the Russian state likely sponsored the plot to assassinate him. Litvinenko, a former Russian agent who defected to the UK, was fatally poisoned with polonium-210 in London in 2006. Horwell emphasizes that the use of polonium points to Russian state involvement, though he clarifies that there is no evidence directly implicating Russian President Vladimir Putin in the murder.

Litvinenko's defection and his public criticism of Putin and the FSB could have been perceived as treachery, providing the Russian state with motives for his assassination. Horwell also notes that Litvinenko had been poisoned twice before his death, and the suspects left a trail of polonium evidence behind. The long-term risks to the public from polonium exposure remain unknown.

Despite the Met Police's desire to see Kovtun and Lugovoi stand trial for murder, extradition attempts have been unsuccessful, and the suspects remain in Russia.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","1. The attack occurred at the Sardar Daud hospital in Afghanistan, where militants used explosives to enter and opened fire on staff and patients.
2. The attack resulted in the deaths of an unspecified number of people and wounded more than 50 others.
3. The so-called Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack, while the Taliban denied involvement.
4. Afghan commandos engaged in a several-hour battle with the attackers, ultimately killing all four assailants.
5. The attack represented a shift in IS tactics in Afghanistan, as it was the first time they directly engaged with security forces in the capital, Kabul. Previously, IS had targeted civilian gatherings, particularly Shia Muslims, and carried out an attack on the Supreme Court last month.
6. The method of the hospital attack, involving blowing open gates to allow gunmen entry, was more characteristic of the Taliban, suggesting IS may have expanded capabilities and resources.
7. IS has been primarily active in the east of Afghanistan, near the Pakistan border, and has not succeeded in broadening its influence significantly since announcing its presence in the country two years ago.
8. The Afghan government has claimed to have driven IS militants out of several bases in the east but has not yet dislodged them from the mountainous areas they control.
9. The attack was widely condemned, including by President Ashraf Ghani and Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah, who vowed to avenge the victims.
10. IS declared its Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since conducted numerous attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including a suicide bombing at a rally in Kabul and attacks during the Ashura festival.

"The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.","1. The All Progressives Congress (APC) secured a significant victory in the Nigerian governorship elections, winning 19 out of 28 available positions, marking the biggest loss for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since the end of military rule in 1999.
2. The PDP, which had previously lost the presidential election to APC leader Muhammadu Buhari, also lost governorships in key northern states such as Katsina and Kaduna, as well as in Adamawa, a state affected by Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the PDP retained control of Rivers State, the country's oil hub, and won eight governorships, primarily in the south-east.
3. The APC's victories have reduced the PDP's influence to mainly the south-east and Niger Delta regions, with the party's national spread significantly diminished. The APC did not win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, which could pose challenges for President-elect Buhari in managing potential disruptions to oil production by militant groups.
4. Elections were not violence-free, with the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reporting 66 violent incidents, mostly in Rivers and other southern states. Despite this, the elections were considered more peaceful than previous years, suggesting progress in Nigeria's democratic processes.
5. The results in Taraba state are still outstanding, and the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive due to a high number of spoilt ballots. Elections were not held in seven states.
6. The APC's victory in Lagos state is particularly noteworthy as it is the first time since 1999 that the president's party will control both the presidency and Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital.
7. The PDP is expected to undergo a period of self-reflection and rebuilding following the loss of power after 16 years, during which it faced corruption allegations and criticism for its handling of the Boko Haram insurgency. The party had also been weakened by the defection of governors and legislators to the APC prior to the elections.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.5574,0.90004,0.94374,1,1.0
"The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty, a US-based environmental lobby group. Mighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, of turning a blind eye to these practices. Both companies reject the allegations. Singapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash-and-burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia. Indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra, South Sumatra, and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. Singapore-based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99% of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry, it says it accounts for less than 1% of the global market. Mighty's report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires. It also says Olam created a ""secretive market for rogue palm oil companies"" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources. But Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a ""very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning, so it's a 'no burn-no peat-no deforestation' compliance policy"". The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday, having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so. Mr Verghese said he believed the firm's current suppliers all met Olam's strict requirements, but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete. He added that producers who do not comply with the company's sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain. Since Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam, Mighty's allegations could link Singapore's state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven. Temasek's investment in Olam means that ""the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze,"" the report says. Temasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they ""fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same."" The fund told the BBC: ""Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address. ""As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam."" It would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record. It is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations. Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible. Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas. The report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam ""bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations,"" bringing the same practices to Africa ""that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia"". In response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent. ""We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done,"" it said. ""Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain.""","1. Mighty, a US environmental lobby group, has accused agricultural commodities trader Olam and its major stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, of contributing to the haze problem in Southeast Asia through unsustainable palm oil trading practices. Both Olam and Temasek reject these allegations.

2. The haze in Singapore and Malaysia is caused by slash-and-burn practices used by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia, particularly in the regions of Riau, South Sumatra, and Kalimantan. Indonesia has been criticized for not adequately addressing these agricultural fires.

3. Olam, which is based in Singapore, purchases 99% of its palm oil from third-party suppliers and accounts for less than 1% of the global palm oil market. Mighty's report suggests that Olam's trading practices may inadvertently support unsustainable palm oil production that contributes to the haze.

4. Olam has a strict sourcing policy that prohibits burning, deforestation, and peatland development. The company has recently released the names of its 14 suppliers and is in the process of vetting them to ensure compliance with its sustainability standards.

5. Temasek, as the majority shareholder in Olam, could be implicated in the annual haze if Olam is found to be sourcing from rogue palm oil producers. Temasek supports no-burn policies but maintains that it does not intervene in the business operations of its portfolio companies.

6. The palm oil industry is a significant global market but is also associated with environmental destruction, illegal labor practices, and conflicts with local communities. There is a debate between environmental groups and palm oil companies regarding the industry's responsibility and ability to monitor third-party suppliers.

7. In Gabon, Mighty accuses Olam of clearing rainforests for palm oil plantations, mirroring the practices that have caused extensive damage in Southeast Asia. Olam defends its actions in Gabon, stating that its partnerships with the government are responsible and transparent, and that only a small percentage of least valuable forested land is being converted for agriculture in a sustainable manner.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.60963,0.85119,0.97343,1,1.0

"Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates.

LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election.

"Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year's Nations Cup. Morocco, meanwhile, were only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned a ban on its participation. We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco ""We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco,"" said Moroccan FA chief Fouzi Lekjaa. ""We are back after a little break of a few months, but it has not had a big impact. The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass."" Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began. The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead. Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000). Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare. The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over. ""I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,"" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport. Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty. The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared. The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup. Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption. ""We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,"" said Snoussi. ""But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium."" ""But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. ""We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected. ""In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match."" Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement. ""Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,"" said Snoussi. ""We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out."" Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F. Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.","Tunisia narrowly avoided expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations after apologizing to the Confederation of African Football (Caf) for complaints they made during the 2015 tournament. The controversy arose from a disputed penalty decision in their quarter-final loss to Equatorial Guinea, which Tunisia felt was unjustifiable and possibly influenced by the crowd. Despite media reports, the Tunisian Football Federation clarified that they did not accuse Caf or the referee of corruption but did question the referee's appointment and capability.

Morocco, on the other hand, was allowed to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned their ban. Morocco had been punished for refusing to host the 2015 Nations Cup due to Ebola fears, seeking a postponement instead. Cas not only lifted the ban but also reduced the fine imposed on the Moroccan Football Association from $1m to $50,000.

Fouzi Lekjaa, the Moroccan FA chief, expressed optimism for the future of African and Moroccan football, downplaying the impact of the ban. Equatorial Guinea had stepped in as hosts for the 2015 finals with only 64 days to prepare.

The resolution of the disputes with Caf means that both Tunisia and Morocco are now focused on the 2017 Nations Cup qualifiers. Tunisia, aiming for their first Nations Cup win since 2004, will face Togo, Liberia, and Djibouti in Group A, while Morocco will compete against Cape Verde, Libya, and Sao Tome in Group F. If Tunisia qualifies for the finals in Gabon, it will mark their thirteenth consecutive appearance at the tournament, setting a new record.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.53373,0.95558,0.91122,1,1.0

The program focuses on patients who exhibit no clear symptoms or signs of cancer but are suspected to be at risk. This initiative follows a visit by local doctors to Denmark to observe their diagnostic systems, which have been credited with improving cancer diagnosis rates.

The concern in Wales is that patients without clear symptoms may wait too long for a diagnosis and may not fit neatly into specific treatment pathways. General practitioners (GPs) often refer these patients for multiple tests over several weeks. Consequently, there is a fear that too many patients start treatment when their cancer is too advanced to be effectively treated.

In Cwm Cynon, 40 GPs believe that referring patients to the diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant within seven days could lead to a more efficient process. The plan is for around six patients per week to be seen and to undergo different tests on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with ""borderline"" symptoms receive a diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area, and doctors aim to reach more of the patient population without such clear symptoms.

A similar trial clinic is being set up at Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another pilot program by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. These trials have been developed over the 12 months since specialists returned from Aarhus, Denmark, where diagnostic centers were established following concerns about the country's cancer diagnosis rates.

Dr. Gareth Davies, Director of the Wales Cancer Network, states that the program will not only reassure patients but also streamline the process. GPs who are unsure about a patient's condition but have concerns can quickly refer them to the clinic, ensuring prompt attention and hopefully a swift diagnosis.

GP Dr. Gareth Jordan from Aberdare suggests that the pilot program could make a significant difference in patients' lives by providing timely and coordinated specialist opinions, which is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment.

If the Cwm Cynon pilot program, set to begin within six months, is successful, other health boards in the region are expected to offer the same service subsequently.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.73565,0.09183,0.00597,1,1.0

Joe Root was awarded man of the match for his exceptional performance, scoring 254 in the first innings and remaining unbeaten on 71 off 48 balls in the second. He also contributed with the ball and in the field, taking four catches and claiming a wicket.

England's captain Alastair Cook praised Root's innings as one of the best he had seen, highlighting his responsibility and skill at the number three position. Root himself acknowledged his previous errors at Lord's and expressed satisfaction with his more controlled play in this match.

Pakistan struggled throughout the match, batting for only 63 overs in the first innings and 70 in the second on a pitch that offered little to the bowlers.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game.

"The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role. Leyton Orient interim manager Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device ""For me to lose two managers this season has been very tough and I've found it very hard this week. ""We had to be professional, we're here to do a job and if I wasn't professional then I wouldn't be true to myself. ""We owe it to the fans. At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club. ""We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs."" Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: ""I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline. ""If you haven't got organisation and you haven't got the discipline to play 90 minutes, the outcome is inevitable. ""Dagenham over the years are going to get beat, it's responding to that that the club's not been able to do this year.""","The passage provides a summary of a match between Dagenham & Redbridge (the Daggers) and Leyton Orient (the O's) in League One, with significant implications for both teams. The Daggers needed a win to maintain their chances of avoiding relegation, but despite goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona, they ultimately lost 3-2 after Armand Gnanduillet scored the winning goal for Orient. This result relegated Dagenham & Redbridge to the National League, a division they had previously ascended to for the first time in their history in 2007 under the management of John Still. The club's return to the National League comes after a period of struggle, marked by the worst goal difference in League Two and a significant increase in goals conceded compared to the previous season. Their attacking output has also diminished, with veteran striker Jamie Cureton's nine goals this season falling short of his previous tally of 20.

For Leyton Orient, the victory keeps their play-off aspirations alive, positioning them just two points outside the play-off zone. The win follows a tumultuous week that saw player-manager Kevin Nolan removed from his managerial role. Interim manager Andy Hessenthaler emphasized the team's professionalism and commitment to the fans despite the challenging circumstances.

John Still, who had returned to Dagenham for his third stint as manager in December, acknowledged his team's lack of organization and discipline, particularly in the first half of the match.

"Ofsted says it has found evidence of children being taught in squalid conditions in three places in Birmingham which have now closed. Anyone running illegal schools could face a jail term of up to 51 weeks. Ministers are also consulting on plans for more regulation of places teaching for more than 6 to 8 hours a week. Sir Michael Wilshaw, Chief Inspector of Schools in England, told the BBC this week that his inspectors were visibly shocked by the conditions they found. It is understood that a total of 18 unregulated schools, mainly in Muslim communities in the Midlands, have been visited as part of an investigation in recent months. Three places in Birmingham have been closed and the owners are being investigated under suspicion of running an illegal school. Sir Michael said the cases uncovered were likely to be the ""tip of the iceberg"" and he was seriously concerned that children were at risk of being abused or radicalised. Any place where children are taught for more than 20 hours a week has to register as a school. Some places describing themselves as part-time education centres or ""flexi schools""  are operating within the law providing support for home-educated children. But Ofsted and ministers are concerned that some are taking advantage of the legal right to home educate to operate what are in fact illegal schools. In a letter to the education secretary on Friday, Sir Michael suggested officials had been slow to take decisive action in the three places which Ofsted had closed with the help of the local council. ""This was achieved in spite of your officials providing, what I believe to be, confusing and unhelpful advice to the proprietors that they could now apply to register their provision."" The government has provided funding for a team of six inspectors whose job will be to investigate illegal schools. While most of the places visited by Ofsted so far have been in Muslim communities, inspectors may also turn their attention to similar unregistered tuition centres operated by other groups. ""It will apply across the board, to any religious group whether Muslim group, Jewish group, or Christian group who wants to operate this sort of provision in unsafe accommodation, in unhygienic and filthy accommodation. ""It will apply to all religious groups, I want to make that absolutely clear,"" Sir Michael told the BBC. The education secretary has now said she intends to go further. ""I have now asked Ofsted to prepare cases for prosecution against unregistered schools it has identified. For a child to spend a single day in one of these schools is unacceptable."" In order for a prosecution to be brought against an unregistered school the Education Secretary has to give consent. The government consultation on further regulation runs until mid-January.","1.

He will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-match ban in competitive international games, while his competitive Barcelona debut is likely to be at Real Madrid on 26 October in El Clasico. But Suarez will now be available for Uruguay's friendlies against Japan and South Korea in September and Saudi Arabia the following month. Suarez's lawyers argued that world governing body Fifa's decision to suspend him from all football-related activity for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 2014 World Cup group match in Brazil in June was too strong a punishment. Switzerland-based Cas - an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations - said: ""The sanctions imposed on the player by Fifa have been generally confirmed."" But it said preventing Suarez from taking part in any football activity was ""excessive"", as not allowing him to train would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended. World players' union Fifpro said it was ""disappointed that the court had decided not to strongly diminish the sanctions"" and ""remain of the view they are disproportionate in relation to his violation of the Fifa disciplinary code"". It added: ""We regret Cas not deciding to reduce the length of Suarez's bans in exchange for an obligation for him to receive treatment."" In addition to being allowed to train and play in friendlies, the former Liverpool player - who moved to Barcelona last month for £75m - can also attend matches and take part in promotional activities. His legal team said the appeal was a success, arguing Fifa had ""misapplied its own rules when considering the case and the sanction it imposed was disproportionate"". Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: ""Luis Suarez's appeal against a four-month ban has failed. He is though, sensibly I think, now allowed to train with the team.""

Suarez apologised nearly a week after the incident, despite initially claiming to have lost his balance.

Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","The passage provides a summary of the life and career of Adrian Gill, a renowned columnist for the Sunday Times, who passed away after a battle with cancer. Gill, known for his exceptional writing skills and dyslexia, which led him to dictate his copy over the phone, had been diagnosed with a severe form of cancer affecting multiple organs. Despite his illness, he remained stoical and expressed gratitude for his life.

Gill was a central figure at the Sunday Times, having joined the paper in 1993. His final column, reflecting on his diagnosis, will be published posthumously. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens praised Gill as a ""giant among journalists,"" highlighting his wit, dazzling writing, and compassion.

Throughout his career, Gill was known for his controversial articles and fearless commentary. He was a prolific writer, author, and broadcaster, admired for his unique style and ability to craft compelling prose. His colleagues and peers, including Jay Rayner and Tim Shipman, remembered him as a kind man, a brilliant writer, and an influential figure in journalism.

Despite his professional success, Gill's articles sometimes sparked controversy, such as when he wrote about shooting a baboon or made disparaging remarks about various regions and groups. He was also censured for a review that included a homophobic slur.

Gill's personal life included multiple marriages and children. He was married to author Cressida Connolly and later to current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with whom he had two children. After their divorce, he became engaged to his long-term partner, Nicola Formby, with whom he had twins.

The passage concludes by noting Gill's humble beginnings, overcoming dyslexia to attend art school and eventually becoming one of the most recognized writers in the industry. His legacy is marked by his distinctive writing style, his impact on journalism, and the profound sense of loss felt by his colleagues and the broader community.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.60483,0.11119,0.05131,1,1.0
"Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar was performing in the country's capital Ulan Bator when the alleged attack took place. Russian news reports said he was hit over the head with a bottle and repeatedly kicked in the face. The Russian embassy said it was investigating, but called local press reports ""distorted"". The rapper had taken to the stage in a red deel - a Mongolian robe - embroidered with a swastika. Though associated with the Nazis, the swastika is a traditional symbol in Mongolia that pre-dates Hitler. Mr Sukhbaatar's father, Sevjidiin Sukhbaatar, told a news conference that his son spent about 10 days in a coma after the beating. ""My son was hit in the face several times with a metal object and was seriously injured. His brain was seriously hurt,"" he said.

Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar - who is known as Amraa and is the lead singer of the band Khar Sarnai [Black Rose] - frequently wears the symbol on stage, and his songs often refer to his country's history, culture and identity. The swastika is also used by groups on Mongolia's far-right however. The musician's lawyer, father, and a band member denied reports on social media that he shouted ""Heil Hitler"" at the show. Lawyer Gankhuugiin Batbayar said the suspect in the beating had not been arrested, adding: ""[He] must be investigated according to Mongolian law, no matter his status or immunity as a diplomat"". A police spokesman told the AFP news agency that the case was under investigation.

"Glamorgan's total was dominated by Nick Selman's mature 101 off 144 balls, his second first-class century. But seamers Matt Taylor and Craig Miles made sure wickets fell at regular intervals in cloudy conditions in the Welsh capital. Gloucestershire struggled in turn as the bowlers remained on top all day. Selman's century, after being dropped on eight in the first over, was a welcome return to form for the Brisbane-born opener after a string of low scores following his hundred against Northants at Swansea. Aneurin Donald's quick-fire 36 off 30 balls was the next best contribution as Taylor and Miles prospered in the afternoon. Graham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten scrambled Glamorgan to a consolation bonus point. Gloucestershire's innings was a question of survival in the evening gloom, with the day ending evenly balanced. Glamorgan are being led by Michael Hogan for the first time in the absence of Jacques Rudolph, who has a neck problem. Glamorgan batsman Nick Selman told BBC Wales Sport: ""It was good to get some runs for a change, the wicket was a bit slow and they bowled a bit short early on so I got through the first 25 overs and it got easier to bat from there, but it was a bit disappointing to get out just after I got a hundred. ""(My season) was going well up until after (a century in) Swansea, after Swansea four ducks in a row, but it was good to spend some time in the middle at Northants. ""Opening the batting in county cricket over here (in the UK), it's definitely hard, you get some good balls, you play on some green wickets and I was struggling a bit. ""I was happy to get a few today and hopefully I can continue that for the rest of the season."" Gloucestershire seamer Matt Taylor told BBC Radio Bristol: ""There's definitely a bit on offer out there (for the bowlers), we didn't start exactly how we'd like but we got there in the end and we'd take bowling them out for 220. ""I was pretty happy with that (hitting the stumps three times), the same plan as always is to hit the top of off-stump and luckily they missed them today. ""I was pleased to get an opportunity in T20 and the white-ball stuff this year, now I'm getting an opportunity with the red ball it's great. ""It's definitely going to be tough (for the Gloucestershire batsmen), they're a good bowling attack but hopefully we can dig in and get to a reasonable score.""","The passage describes a cricket match between Glamorgan and Gloucestershire, with the following key points:

- Nick Selman was the standout batsman for Glamorgan, scoring 101 off 144 balls, which was his second first-class century and a significant contribution to Glamorgan's total. His innings was particularly notable as he had been struggling with form after a previous century against Northants at Swansea.
- Gloucestershire seamers Matt Taylor and Craig Miles managed to take wickets consistently throughout the day, capitalizing on cloudy conditions in Cardiff.
- Glamorgan's bowlers, including Graham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten, kept the pressure on Gloucestershire's batsmen, ensuring that the bowlers remained dominant throughout the day's play.
- Aneurin Donald provided a quick 36 runs off 30 balls, which was the second-highest score for Glamorgan.
- Glamorgan managed to secure a consolation bonus point, with their innings ending on a balanced note against Gloucestershire's bowling in the evening.
- Michael Hogan captained Glamorgan in place of Jacques Rudolph, who was absent due to a neck injury.
- Nick Selman expressed satisfaction with his performance after a series of low scores and acknowledged the difficulty of opening the batting in UK county cricket.
- Matt Taylor, a Gloucestershire seamer, highlighted the assistance the pitch offered to bowlers and was pleased with his performance, including hitting the stumps three times.

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130. Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining. Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: ""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together. ""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open. ""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270. ""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees: ""We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough. ""The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably.""","The passage describes a cricket match where after being 8-2, the team scored 255-7, with notable partnerships between Davies and Ben Foakes, who scored 90 and shared a 130-run stand. Yorkshire's attempt to chase the score was hindered by Stuart Meaker's three-wicket haul, which included key wickets of Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Despite Tim Bresnan's 68 runs, Yorkshire fell short by 19 runs, all out for 236. Earlier, Yorkshire had a good start by taking early wickets, but missed opportunities, including dropping Davies when he was on 43, proved costly. Davies went on to score a significant innings before being dismissed by Matthew Waite, who took 3-48 but also dropped a catch from Foakes. Yorkshire lost wickets at crucial times and ultimately failed to score the required runs in the final overs. Surrey's captain, Gareth Batty, praised his team's performance and the pivotal partnership between Davies and Foakes, while Yorkshire's captain, Alex Lees, expressed disappointment, noting that their bowlers performed well but the batsmen failed to make significant contributions when it mattered most.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.51168,0.7506,0.84704,1,1.0

"In his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds. It is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid. Back then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge. They are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four. If they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers. But not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick. Part of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault. Where he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front. Between them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season. With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up. But he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system. Looking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough. It is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team. That means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes. Doing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight. In their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games. They look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault. When I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield. Again, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once. Another problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team. More than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically. Sadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem. Liverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right. From Mamadou Sakho for £18m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for £20m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer. They still look all over the place at the back. Statistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better. Liverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected. What Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there. Simon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box. Rodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea. He was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it. Liverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home. Now he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays. My team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini. For me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu. It is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough. It is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet He was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season. Although he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea. To compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack. Whether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back. That way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks. Going forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed. The trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli. He will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy. Even if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment. Jose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either. The only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric. The Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points. There is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans. Whatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished. He was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future. Playing in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club. The older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one. At 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle. What he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively. Because, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that ""his legs have gone"". Of course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test. What happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside But it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation. As you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone. There is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't. I knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them. What does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself. I knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer. For me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players. Of all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with. He was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen. Saturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside. Of course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him. It would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does. It is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too. Robbie Savage was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan","The passage discusses the challenges Liverpool faces in replicating last season's title challenge, particularly focusing on the team's current performance, transfer decisions, and the future of Steven Gerrard. Liverpool's recent form and inability to score early in games, as they did last season, suggest they are far from another title challenge. The loss of Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge's injuries have significantly reduced their goal-scoring capabilities, and the new strikers brought in have not met expectations in terms of scoring and work-rate.

Liverpool's defense remains a concern despite investment in players like Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren. The team's defensive issues persist, and their goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, is criticized for not commanding his area effectively.

The passage also delves into the team selection for the upcoming match against Chelsea, suggesting a lineup that includes dropping the underperforming Lovren. Liverpool's prospects against Chelsea are viewed as slim, with Chelsea being the dominant team in the Premier League.

Finally, the passage reflects on Steven Gerrard's role and future at Liverpool. Despite his age and the physical demands of the game, Gerrard remains a key player for Liverpool, and his performance against Newcastle exemplifies his continued importance to the team. The psychological impact of his costly slip against Chelsea last season is acknowledged, but his determination and ability to adapt his game suggest he can still contribute significantly to Liverpool's success.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.61967,0.81873,0.97696,1,1.0

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.""","The passage discusses the funding decisions made by UK Sport for Olympic and Paralympic sports leading up to the Tokyo 2020 Games. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 sports, which is £2m less than what was allocated for the Rio Games. Despite Britain's success in Rio, with 67 Olympic and 147 Paralympic medals, some sports have faced funding cuts or removal.

Cycling, which previously brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio, has had its funding cut by over £4m to £25.98m. Badminton, which won a bronze medal in Rio after receiving £5.74m in the last cycle, has had its funding completely removed, a decision that Badminton England's chief executive Adrian Christy described as ""incomprehensible"" and having a ""catastrophic impact"" on the sport. In contrast, Judo, which also won a bronze medal, received a slight increase in funding.

UK Sport has set ambitious targets for Tokyo, aiming for 51-85 Olympic medals and 115-162 Paralympic medals. The government and National Lottery are providing the funding, with UK Sport Chair Rod Carr emphasizing the need to maintain the success achieved in Rio. UK Sport's CEO Liz Nicholl explained that the decision to cut funding was to prioritize sports with the highest medal potential, ensuring that resources are not spread too thinly.

Sports minister Tracey Crouch supported UK Sport's approach, which has been successful in past Games. However, basketball, handball, and volleyball, which had their funding withdrawn in previous years, criticized UK Sport for not investing in team sports and performance pathways, despite a review recommending such investments.

The funding for five new Olympic sports and two new Paralympic sports for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed, with £9m of the total £345m still unallocated.

"The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000. The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe. In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection. Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus. It can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost. That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes. The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece. The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy. ""Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc. ""Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,"" he told BBC News. Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida. The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the ""revolution"" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan. The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year. Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace. The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight. More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth. There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade. OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage. Equity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a ""truly global company"" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority. ""A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,"" said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger. ""And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries."" One aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions. The fear is that space could eventually become unusable. A recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other. Brian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation. ""We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,"" he told BBC News. ""We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit."" Time will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole. Airbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment. ""Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,” said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos","The passage describes the development of a satellite network by OneWeb, with the goal of providing global broadband connectivity, including to every school. The project plans to launch at least 600 spacecraft initially, with the potential to expand to over 2,000. This requires a significant shift in satellite manufacturing, moving towards high-volume, low-cost production methods similar to those used in the automotive and aviation industries. Airbus, a major aerospace company, is collaborating with OneWeb to establish assembly lines that can produce three satellites per shift at a cost of less than a million dollars each.

The first assembly line has been inaugurated in Toulouse, France, with two more planned for Florida. These new lines incorporate automation, such as robot trolleys, and require suppliers to adapt to the high-volume production model. The first 10 satellites are scheduled to launch in April of the following year, with more launches planned to deploy nearly 300 satellites by the end of 2020, over 600 a year later, and more than 800 by the middle of the decade. This will be the largest rocket campaign in spaceflight history, utilizing over 20 Soyuz vehicles.

OneWeb is not the only company planning such a constellation, with competitors like SpaceX, Boeing, and ViaSat also in the mix. However, OneWeb has raised $1.7 billion in equity and is seeking additional loans to complete its network. The company is registered in the UK's Channel Islands and will work with the UK Space Agency for licensing, which will also focus on debris mitigation to prevent space junk from rendering space unusable. OneWeb has committed to de-orbiting its satellites within two years and incorporating hardware to facilitate this process.

The new manufacturing approaches could be disruptive to the satellite industry, and while not all satellites will require high-volume production, Airbus anticipates making satellites for other companies using these new methods.

The Scottish government argues that cuts imposed by the UK government since 2010 - along with last month's spending review - mean that its discretionary budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms by 2019-20 than it was in 2010-11. Mr Swinney said 4.2% of that reduction would come between now and 2019-20. He said: ""The chancellor (George Osborne) has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020, and more than £1bn of those cuts are still to come between now and the end of the decade. ""We have demonstrated that the UK government didn't have to take this approach. Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor. ""Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor's decision. We face tough choices in the coming days. ""Against this backdrop, the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on."" Mr Swinney said schools, hospitals and the police service in Scotland would ""not be sacrificed to the chancellor's austerity obsession"". He added: ""In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland. More police, lower crime, better schools, tuition-free university education and a health budget that is at a record level. ""These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government."" Responding to Mr Swinney comments, a spokesman for the UK government's Scotland Office said: ""The Scottish government will have £390m more spending available to it next year, which rises to £750m if you include its own underspend. ""The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £30bn. ""One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government. ""The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers and getting the best for Scotland, rather than grievance."" Labour's public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: ""Ahead of the most important budget since devolution, it's time John Swinney backed up his anti-austerity posturing with something real. ""Telling us about pre-election giveaways now and cuts later isn't good enough. This needs to be a long-term budget. ""Scotland needs a government that spends less time congratulating itself on its spin and more time explaining its record. ""Scottish Labour will offer a real alternative to austerity, with different decisions on tax to the Tories, and different decisions on tax to the SNP.""","1. Mr Swinney, the Scottish Finance Secretary, stated that the UK government's spending review has put ""unprecedented pressure"" on Scotland's public spending.
2. Despite the UK government's claim that Scottish ministers will have an additional £390m for spending in the next year, Mr Swinney is set to present his 2016-17 spending plans amidst concerns over budget cuts.
3. The Scottish government asserts that the cumulative effect of UK government cuts since 2010, compounded by the recent spending review, will result in a 12.5% real-terms reduction in its discretionary budget by 2019-20, compared to 2010-11 levels. Mr Swinney highlighted that 4.2% of this reduction is expected to occur between now and 2019-20.
4. Mr Swinney criticized Chancellor George Osborne for planning real-terms cuts for Scotland every year until 2020, with over £1bn in cuts still to come. He argued that the UK government could have reduced debt and the deficit without such extensive cuts.
5. Despite the financial constraints, Mr Swinney pledged to protect essential services like schools, hospitals, and the police from the UK government's austerity measures. He pointed to past achievements such as increased police numbers, lower crime rates, improved education, tuition-free university education, and a record-high health budget as evidence of the Scottish government's priorities.
6. A UK government Scotland Office spokesman responded by highlighting the £390m increase in Scotland's spending power next year, which could reach £750m if the Scottish government's underspend is included. The spokesman emphasized the stability of the UK economy and the block grant nearing £30bn, suggesting that this situation is preferable to the Scottish government's favored constitutional alternative, especially given the current oil prices.
7. Labour's public services spokeswoman, Jackie Baillie, challenged Mr Swinney to move beyond rhetoric and present a substantive budget that addresses long-term needs, criticizing the SNP's approach to austerity and calling for different tax decisions than those made by the Tories and the SNP.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.45243,0.80063,0.95911,1,1.0
"For many people with severe disabilities, their families and carers, this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house. In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven't got a suitable area to spend a penny. Ordinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet?"" Recommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory. Lorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory ""It's like playing Russian roulette,"" Lorna says. ""Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful. ""My daughter is only six so she doesn't have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through, but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty."" Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people. There are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they? They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet  the needs of people who use them. Mike LeSurf, Changing Places Development Officer at Mencap says: ""There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door, people's needs are not being met."" Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away. ""Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn't a bench and hoist in the toilet,"" she says. ""You just begin to get this sense of feeling like you're last in the line to be considered. ""It's soul-destroying and you don't feel like a valued member of society at all."" But it is not all doom and gloom and Alison gets by with a little help from her friends. She said: ""Freddie went to a party and one of my friends converted a room into a 'pop-up' changing places, and brought stuff from home to kit it out - it was amazing"" Alison even tweeted from the party: ""Friends for life are those who organise parties in the village hall and provide a 'pop up' #changingplace so ALL can go!"" Bethan Folen and her daughter Lowri also enjoy their ""girls' days out"" now there are more convenient and fully accessible places to change nearby. She said: ""Lowri's favourite thing to do is to go to the Millennium Stadium [now known as the Principality Stadium] in Cardiff and watch Wales play rugby. She is a massive fan. Even before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet, says Bethan, ""There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change Lowri"" Changing Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines (BS 8300:2009) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement. Architect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem. ""By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment,"" she says. ""As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this."" For businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans. At 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m). Because of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations. Arsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too. Alun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: ""There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt. ""But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience. ""They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible. ""You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important.""","The passage discusses the challenges faced by individuals with severe disabilities and their families when it comes to accessing suitable toilet facilities. Standard accessible toilets do not meet the needs of all disabled people, particularly those requiring two carers or a hoist for assistance. Changing Places toilets, which are larger and have additional features, are recommended for installation in larger buildings such as shopping centers and sports stadiums, but are not yet compulsory.

Lorna Fillingham, a mother of a disabled child, has started a petition to make Changing Places facilities mandatory in building regulations, highlighting the stress and indignity of not having access to appropriate changing facilities. Alison Beevers also describes the emotional impact of the lack of Changing Places toilets on her family.

The passage notes that there are 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK, but more are needed. The specifications for these facilities have been included in building standards since 2009, but as recommendations, not requirements, leading to inconsistent provision.

The benefits of Changing Places toilets are illustrated by personal stories, including how the installation of these facilities has positively impacted the lives of individuals like Bethan Folen and her daughter Lowri, and the positive reception at Arsenal Football Club, which was the first Premier League club to install one.

Campaigners are pushing for a change in regulations to make Changing Places toilets compulsory in new large complexes, arguing that this would provide clarity for designers and ensure that the needs of all customers are considered by businesses.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.91826,0.95129,0.98828,1,1.0

"The poster with the phrase #prayforjosh appeared in Holywood by the A2 within the last week. It is part of a social media campaign supporting 13-year-old Joshua Martin, from Donaghadee, County Down. Life took a dramatic turn for the teenager when he was diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Eve. He was due to have an operation on his appendix at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. However, doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller growths. The news shocked Josh's family, but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world. It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Elim Church, where Josh's father is on the pastoral staff, and has since gone viral. The church's senior pastor, Gary Beattie, said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far. ""We were in total shock when he was diagnosed, and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh,"" Gary said. ""It certainly isn't a campaign as such, we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him. We had no idea that it would take off.

"It comes in a shake-up of UK military buildings and resettling of regiments. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure, saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805, home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke's Drift. ""This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way,"" he said. ""The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town. ""Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history, with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century. ""This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history."" Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision, saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales. He also hoped the closure would not damage the town's ""thriving"" military tourism industry. Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk. Mr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. Cawdor Barracks, Pembrokeshire - whose closure was previously announced in 2013 - will now shut in 2024, while a storage depot at Sennybridge will go in 2025. Responding for Labour, Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith, MP for Llanelli, said the ministry was ""right to restructure its estate"". But she warned closing bases would affect the livelihoods of many people who would face ""gnawing uncertainty"" over their future.","The passage describes a significant reorganization of UK military bases, particularly affecting Wales, which includes the closure of Brecon Barracks.

Davies criticizes the government's lack of respect for this history and has launched a petition to oppose the closure. He also expresses concern about the impact on local employment and the military tourism industry in Brecon, which has high unemployment rates.

"It also warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal. Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign. The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain. This dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June. Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway. However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry. Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it ""must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations"". What complicates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states. The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states. ""A successful industry,"" the report says, ""therefore needs continued market access."" However, that access may come at a price. ""Brexit will involve many trade-offs,"" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee. ""It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs."" The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states. One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away ""raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes"" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. However, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats. Just this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns. Responding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU. ""With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,"" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement. ""This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities."" In response to the report, a government spokesperson said: ""As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market."" ""At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.""

2. The House of Lords European Union Committee released a report highlighting the risks and opportunities for the UK fishing industry post-Brexit.

"Ed Snowden, a 29-year-old former technical worker for the CIA, has since revealed himself to be the source of the leaks in an interview with the Guardian news website. US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as ""extremely damaging"" to national security, but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance ""horrifying"". What could the US government see? According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data of individuals. The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon, which included call duration, location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls. How much do the spooks know? Why every call matters What can you learn from phone records? According to the documents, Prism also enabled ""backdoor"" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple. These servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches. All the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works. National Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. ""If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said Some experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"". ""The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,"" he said. ""Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar."" What about data-protection laws? Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity. Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring. Facebook's privacy policy, for example, states: "" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities"". Are we all being watched? The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy. ""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran. Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""law abiding citizens"" in Britain would ""never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up"". Does it make a difference which country you live in? User data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being ""transferred to and stored in"" the US. The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way. This method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC. ""Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,"" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act. ""In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests."" Are other governments involved? UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism. It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007. In a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was ""concerned"" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was ""seeking more details"" from the US authorities. ""Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),"" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding. What does this mean for internet use? William Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of ""opting out"" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security. However privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its ""worst fears and suspicions"". ""Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,"" says  Privacy International on its website. ""The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse."" Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy. ""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of thingsâ€¦ I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,"" he told the Guardian.","29-year-old Edward Snowden, a former CIA technical worker, has identified himself as the source of leaked documents revealing extensive US surveillance programs. These programs, operated by the National Security Agency (NSA), involve access to a vast array of personal communication data, including chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers, and social networking activity. The NSA also confirmed the collection of millions of phone records from Verizon, detailing call duration, location, and the numbers involved.

The leaked documents suggest that the NSA's Prism program allows ""backdoor"" access to servers of major tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, potentially giving the agency insight into private social media posts, web chats, and internet searches. However, these companies have denied involvement, and the actual functionality of Prism remains unclear.

NSA Director Keith Alexander has defended these operations as necessary for national security, while President Obama has acknowledged the tension between security and privacy. Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated that the NSA accesses phone records only in cases related to al-Qaeda or Iran.

Data protection laws typically regulate company handling of customer data rather than government surveillance. Many companies' privacy policies include clauses allowing them to share information for legal reasons.

The global nature of data storage, particularly with the rise of cloud computing, means that user data may be subject to foreign laws, such as the US Patriot Act, which can compel American companies to provide access to data regardless of the user's nationality.

The UK government has not confirmed or denied its involvement with Prism, and the EU has expressed concern over the implications for EU citizens' privacy. The existence of Prism has heightened privacy concerns and affirmed the fears of groups like Privacy International. Snowden's motivation for leaking the information was his concern over privacy and the creation of a society where all actions and communications are recorded.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.25283,0.82016,0.97097,1,1.0

"However, since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation. In 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected, Indian-dominated coalition. This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy. A further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks. These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation. Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years. In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history. In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member. Fiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India. The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority. Mixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society. There are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans. Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing. Nonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid.","1.

"Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told the BBC ""Syria is doing its best"" to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons. Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over its entire stockpile. Mr Mekdad said a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia. ""We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast,"" he said. ""The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups."" He added: ""This is a serious business. Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration."" He described as ""absolutely unacceptable"" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters. Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area. ""We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians,"" Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of ""still supporting terrorist elements"" in the country. The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees. But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had ""thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups"". The Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison. It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions. Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons. The US said last week that so far only about 4% of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was ""concerned"" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus ""had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment"". Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March. A deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is overseeing the destruction operation, has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen.

""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either.

"He is appealing against an appeal court ruling lifting a ban on him being named in the media in England and Wales. The Supreme Court said it will now hear arguments about whether it should grant an appeal, and if so, decide if it should be ""allowed or dismissed"".

PJS opposed that application and said the ban should stay. On Monday, the judges ruled that PJS was now unlikely to be able to get a permanent injunction Details about the allegations were now ""so widespread"" that confidentiality had ""probably been lost"", they said.

"The Electoral Commission said 38 MPs had highlighted people, including students, claiming to have voted twice, which is a criminal offence. It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries. Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote. A record number of 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, 500,000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46.4 million figure for the EU referendum. Of these, 68.7% actually voted on the day, the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997. There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline. In total, 2.9 million applications were received over the six-week period. Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10%, including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury, Cambridge, Bristol West and Leeds Central. However, concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year's EU referendum - continue to persist. At the moment, there is no direct link between electoral registers, which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain, and the online registration service now used by a majority of people. The two systems use different databases and cannot communicate directly with each other. Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline, about 4.9 million applications to vote were submitted, the majority of them done online. But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1.4 million, suggesting ""a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates"". With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered, the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30% and 70% in different areas. The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites, including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland. Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May's local council elections, the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed. ""The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service, in comparison to the difficult of contacting a local authority electoral services team by telephone or email to check if they were already registered, meant many people simply submitted another application,"" the report said. Although there was a lack of evidence to back up claims on social media that some people had voted twice, the watchdog said it took the issue very seriously and anyone with information should contact the police. It stressed that although some people - including students and those with second homes - may lawfully be able to register in more than one constituency and cast more than one vote in local elections, voting twice in a general election was an offence punishable by an unlimited fine. The ""dispersed and unconnected"" nature of the 381 electoral registers in Britain means it is not possible to collectively cross-check entries, the watchdog said, and being able to do so would significantly reduce the risk of double voting. It is also calling for people who are registered in two seats to choose in advance which one they will vote in at future general elections. Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement, Cat Smith, said voting twice was a serious offence and police needed to have the resources to prosecute people suspected of doing so. But she warned against a knee-jerk reaction, given the rise in registration and turnout, particularly among younger voters. ""A blanket ban on being registered at two addresses would exclude those who for reasons of work or study need to be registered in two places,"" she said. ""This cannot be an attempt to make it harder for young people and students to register to vote.""","The Electoral Commission reported that 38 MPs raised concerns about individuals, including students, who allegedly voted twice in the 8 June election, an act which is a criminal offense.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Emotion. Drama. Excitement. Brilliant football. Noise. Colour. And all this even before Liverpool's Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The Kop in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre. It was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's almost crazed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund, the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel. Liverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe's second-rate pot - not a label anyone was attaching to it after this classic. Liverpool into last four after Euro thriller Istanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp Liverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan When Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October, he revealed one of his priorities was to ""turn doubters into believers"". And it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory, both on the pitch and in the stands. If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened. In nine blistering minutes from the first whistle, this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart, with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration. Liverpool needed three goals, leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005, saying: ""Even if it is not likely it is possible, so we should try."" And yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice, Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes. It was time for believers, time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon. And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touchstone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren. Borussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw-dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up. It takes us back to more words from Klopp. After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early, saying it made him feel alone and adding: ""We decide when it's over."" This was a phrase that could have been stamped on the foreheads of Liverpool's players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do. If anyone entered Anfield as a doubter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left. This night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour, the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The Kop. Before the teams emerged, Anfield was serenaded by arguably the longest version of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" ever heard at the stadium, Gerry Marsden's voice turned off and Liverpool's supporters taking over, the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence. A minute's silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed, Anfield a cauldron of emotions. It was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages, cut to pieces by high-class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere. Slowly, after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit, the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were unnerved to the point where their resolve was broken. Klopp was a man possessed on the touchline, waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players, pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise. It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night. Tuchel said: ""When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change. There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be. Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmospheres ever at a football match."" Klopp added: ""It was brilliant, outstanding, emotional, everything. I will not forget it because it was special. I know this is a place for big football moments. We didn't start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories."" There was certainly a new, unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night. In the afterglow of such sporting brilliance, there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool's performance. It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed. And yet, when there is time for reflection, it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool. Divock Origi's goal, his fourth in his past three games, was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge. Even as Liverpool battled Dortmund's supremacy, Origi showed power, pace and a willingness to fight. Very much the Klopp template, recalling the words of his manager after his first game in charge at Tottenham six months ago: ""We're going to have a lot of fun with this player."" Media playback is not supported on this device Emre Can has had a mixed season but was outstanding before picking up an injury, while Coutinho sprinkles the stardust on this Liverpool team. It seems like splitting hairs after such a glorious spectacle, but Liverpool still have a vulnerability at the back that will surely be addressed by Klopp in the summer. Alberto Moreno is a weak link at left-back and while Sakho may be a popular figure with supporters, talking of ""a win for the Liverpool country"" and taking selfies on the pitch with Origi, close inspection suggests his positional play was something of an adventure for Dortmund's goals. One thing is clear, however, and qualifies as the biggest plus of all - in the space of six months Klopp has imprinted his identity on his new players and Liverpool's fans. The evidence was all over Anfield. Most definitely - indeed many felt the winner of this tie would go on to claim the trophy. It was not a notion welcomed or encouraged by Klopp. Sevilla, winners for the last two seasons, still lurk after beating Athletic Bilbao on penalties while another Spanish side Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up a high-powered last four. But there is almost the spirit of Champions League 2005 about Liverpool's run in the Europa League. Back then Liverpool moved along with no great expectation to not only find themselves in the final but winning it. Klopp will guard against any complacency but the way in which Liverpool pulled off an extraordinary feat on Thursday will give them growing confidence that no task is too onerous for them at Anfield in the semi-finals. The Europa League is not the only prize within reach - a return to the Champions League via victory in this tournament is now tantalisingly coming into view. The famous ""This Is Anfield"" sign has greeted players on the path to the pitch for decades - many touch it for luck and Klopp even did so himself on a visit to the stadium for a friendly when coach of Borussia Dortmund. It carries an aura but Klopp has put a banning order on his players, saying: ""I've told my players you need to win something before you touch the 'This Is Anfield'. It's a sign of respect. You don't do it - it is too big."" Klopp has delivered another incentive to his Liverpool charges.","The passage describes a thrilling UEFA Europa League quarter-final match between Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund at Anfield, which Liverpool won 4-3 with a late goal from Dejan Lovren. The game was filled with emotion, drama, and excitement, showcasing brilliant football and a vibrant atmosphere. Liverpool's victory, inspired by manager Jurgen Klopp, moved them closer to qualifying for the Champions League and was reminiscent of the 2005 Champions League Final in Istanbul, where Liverpool came back from a 3-0 deficit.

Liverpool fell behind 2-0 within nine minutes due to goals from Dortmund's Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but they mounted a remarkable comeback with goals from Divock Origi, Philippe Coutinho, and Mamadou Sakho, before Lovren's injury-time winner. The match was a testament to Liverpool's resilience and Klopp's motivational skills, as they overcame a strong Dortmund side led by Thomas Tuchel.

The atmosphere at Anfield was electric, with a long rendition of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and a minute's silence observed for the Hillsborough disaster. Klopp's influence on the team and fans was evident, with his philosophy of never giving up and his emphasis on belief over doubt resonating throughout the stadium.

The victory highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of Liverpool's squad, with praise for Origi's composure, Coutinho's skill, and Emre Can's performance, while also noting defensive vulnerabilities, particularly with left-back Alberto Moreno and Sakho's positional play.

Liverpool's progress in the Europa League has sparked comparisons to their 2005 Champions League triumph, with the team growing in confidence under Klopp. The win puts them in a strong position for the semi-finals and brings them closer to securing a Champions League spot for next season. Klopp has instilled a sense of respect for the club's history by discouraging his players from touching the ""This Is Anfield"" sign until they win a trophy, adding further motivation for the team as they pursue silverware.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.7399,0.50015,0.90478,1,1.0
"The views were expressed following a meeting of the EU Negotiation Joint Ministerial Committee in London.

"""I'm feeling the joints for any kind of heat or swelling."" Veterinary surgeon Dr Sandra Corr puts Daisy the sheep through a very hands-on physical examination. ""I'm looking for any signs of crepitus or lameness,"" she says, ""Anything that might indicate the onset of disease or osteoarthritis."" But Daisy is not just any sheep. She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996. This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters. ""Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,"" he says. We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests. As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation. But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world. According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results. He tells me: ""One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?"" Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some ""age-memory"" might be transferred into the next generation. ""That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,"" says Prof Sinclair. ""A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age."" The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down. But by then Dolly was already suffering from osteoarthritis which, although not unheard of in a sheep of her age, did raise concerns about premature aging. The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more clones. ""We wanted to know if Dolly's untimely death was just unlucky"", recalled Prof Sinclair, ""or if it was something to do with the cloning process itself. If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cloned animals."" Getting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dollies, and nine other sheep cloned from different cell lines, through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-body fMRI scans. Prof Sinclair said: ""We focused on three co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoarthritis - the three co-morbidities most associated with aging. Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-morbidities."" The results of the study, which could have profound implications for the future of cloning, will be published next week. But for now, the dollies, which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays, seem to be in rude health. Follow Tom on Twitter.","1. Veterinary surgeon Dr. Sandra Corr is conducting a physical examination on Daisy, a cloned sheep, looking for signs of joint issues or diseases like osteoarthritis.
2. Daisy is one of 13 cloned sheep at the University of Nottingham and is a clone of the same adult ewe as Dolly, the first cloned mammal. Despite the time passed, these sheep are considered identical twin sisters to Dolly.
3. The sheep are undergoing detailed health tests to assess their aging process and overall health, as there is concern that cloned animals might exhibit premature aging due to potential ""age-memory"" from the adult cells used in cloning.
4. Dolly's death at six-and-a-half years old, due to a virus and complications from osteoarthritis, prompted the creation of more clones from the original cell line to study the potential link between cloning and premature aging.
5. The study, led by Professor Kevin Sinclair, involves rigorous testing, including joint X-rays and full-body fMRI scans, to examine the prevalence of age-related diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoarthritis in the cloned sheep.
6. The findings of the study, which could significantly impact the field of cloning, are set to be published soon. Currently, the cloned sheep, known as the dollies, are in good health as they approach their ninth and tenth birthdays.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.76619,0.94739,0.98517,1,1.0

Meanwhile, the ""volatility index"" - a measure of investors' uncertainty - has hit levels last seen in the 2008 financial crisis. The Leave campaign argued that the pound simply retreated to March levels. The pound was down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.4226. Against the euro, sterling was down 0.6% at â‚¬1.2605 and weakened by 1% against the Japanese yen to just over 151.

"They range from extra responsibility for off-street parking, through to tourism. Potentially, though, the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions. Councils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas. Currently, if you want to build a new house or erect an extension, you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service, an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont's environment department. Planning officials refer your application to your local council. The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application, but the final say rests with the Planning Service. From April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves, meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions. So is this a positive move, democratising our planning system? Michael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE, is optimistic. Mr Corr already works with councils and government departments, providing advice on new developments like leisure centres. He told me the move is ""a huge opportunity for the future, which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans"". But do Northern Ireland's politicians have the necessary skills? Speaking about voters, Mr Corr said: ""They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues, because it's those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference."" However, not everyone is so upbeat. Back in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing. Protests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement. The environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent. James Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: ""In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities."" Mr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a ""tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here"". He said: ""It's quite easy to see that continuing, where we get a laissez-faire system which says, 'you look after your community and we won't bother engaging in proper democratic planning' . That is a real danger and that's why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place."" Friends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties. Some local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security. Others argue that the Â£7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts. Under the terms of a law passed earlier this year, it's up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations.","1. The passage discusses a shift in planning decision responsibility from the Planning Service to local councils in Northern Ireland, effective from April 2015. This change means that elected politicians will make planning decisions, including those for new houses or extensions, which were previously under the jurisdiction of the Planning Service, an agency of Stormont's environment department.

2. Michael Corr, the creative director of PLACE, sees this as a positive move, believing it to be a significant opportunity for local councils to develop their own community and development plans. He emphasizes the importance of voters choosing politicians who understand urban regeneration and planning issues.

3. Concerns have been raised by environmental group Friends of the Earth, which cautions that a strict code of conduct must be enforced to ensure fairness and transparency in the new system. They reference historical discrimination in housing allocation by local councils in the 1960s, which contributed to the Civil Rights movement, as a reason for caution.

4. James Orr from Friends of the Earth expresses worry about potential corruption due to close relationships between developers and political parties, suggesting that without proper transparency, the new system could lead to biased planning permissions.

5. Friends of the Earth also argue for greater transparency in political donations, given the increased powers and financial implications for developers and objectors. This is contentious, as some local politicians fear that revealing donors could deter them due to security concerns, while others point out that the current £7,500 limit for declaring donations is not reflective of the financial landscape of Northern Ireland's political parties.

6. The decision to increase transparency regarding political donations lies with the Northern Ireland Secretary, who has the authority to make an order to that effect under a law passed earlier in the year.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.82621,0.94063,0.98583,1,1.0

""The gun that was used must have some power because the pellet actually went through her back leg, that's why it was so badly damaged,"" she said. ""She's now learning how to hop around the house, it's terrible. ""The fact that it was three shots is crazy. We live in a housing estate and there are lots of kids. That just makes it worse because any of them could have been hit in the crossfire."" She added: ""There's some sick people out there, hopefully somebody will know who's done this and let the police or the Scottish SPCA know."" Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said: ""Teenie's owners are understandably very upset and keen for us to find the callous person responsible to ensure no more cats come to harm. ""This is an alarming incident which only highlights why the Scottish government should implement the licensing of airguns as a matter of urgency."" He added: ""The new licensing regime should ensure that only those with a lawful reason are allowed to possess such a dangerous weapon. It will also help the police trace anyone using an air gun irresponsibly."" Last year the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons, with a large majority of those who responded opposing the plan. Under the proposed scheme, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so. A total of 87% of respondents rejected the idea - with some describing it as ""draconian"" and ""heavy-handed"". A small number of people felt ministers were not going far enough.

Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him.

"But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. ""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"". The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. ""I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,"" said Mr Mason.","The passage discusses the findings of a study on the use of tablet devices in schools, commissioned by Tablets for Schools and conducted by Dr. Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group.

The number of tablets in schools is expected to nearly double between 2014 and 2016, from approximately 430,000 to almost 900,000.

However, head teachers have reported positive impacts, such as increased motivation among pupils who might otherwise be disengaged, and greater family involvement when tablets are taken home. Dr. Clarke predicts that the role of technology in schools will continue to expand.

A separate study by the National Literacy Trust and Pearson suggests that touch-screen computers, including tablets, are particularly beneficial for boys and poorer pupils in learning to read. It also indicates that children from lower-income households are more likely to read on touch-screen devices than on printed books.

"The exhibition Growing Up in the City at the Museum of Liverpool boasts 25 evocative photographs which capture the life of children over more than 100 years. As well as a providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood, the pictures also provide a thought-provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades. The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets. The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park. The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard. As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work. A nervous looking young maid for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900. The exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones, Curator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool. Ms Jones painstakingly trawled through hundreds of images from the National Museums Liverpool's collections before deciding on the final 25 for the exhibition. She said: ""This has been a fascinating exhibition to work on. ""Looking through hundreds of different postcards, photographs and glass plate negatives in our collections; it was hard to decide on the final 25 images. ""I chose the ones that really stood out and told the experience of childhood. ""People love seeing old photographs and most people can relate to the same experiences of playing out in the street if they're from Liverpool or anywhere else. ""But, at the same time, the pictures also remind us of how things have changed.

"It decided to reorganise the way patients were diagnosed by GPs and specialists by bringing in a new approach, especially to deal with those cancer cases which are not initially obvious. A team of cancer specialists, GPs, NHS and public health experts from Wales have just returned from a fact-finding visit to Aarhus, Denmark's second city. So what was the problem? Prof Frede Olesen of Aarhus University said the changes followed ""quite alarming"" cancer survival statistics more than 15 years ago showing Denmark was performing poorly compared to other European countries, including the rest of Scandinavia. Part of the problem was that waiting times patients faced before getting diagnosed were too long. It was not so much the most serious cases where patients came to the GP with obvious symptoms. They could be fast-tracked to specialists in hospital. It was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out. ""We looked at 30,000 cancer cases - and more than 25% of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn't think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it's important to find those cases,"" said Prof Olesen. What were the changes? The model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes. First -  for patients with "" alarm"" symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast-track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets. In addition to that, by law, any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral. Second, the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs cannot diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them, whether it is cancer or something else. GP Dr Hanne Heje, who works in Aarhus - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer. It also stops the ""ping pong"" between GPs and different specialists. ""Now we know there's a department meeting the patient with open arms saying 'we welcome you', even though there's not a diagnosis written on their forehead,"" she said. The third route deals with the group of patients with minor symptoms, which are very unlikely to be cancer but in rare cases could be. These patients go to so-called ""yes-no"" centres which offer a simple test or scan so they can be seen quickly and any problems identified. ""This can be solved within hours in some cases but 1% will have a serious disease and this can be detected,"" said Prof Olesen. ""For these patients before - they might have had to wait four to six months, so for the small percentage where something is found, they'd start treatment six months behind the time schedule."" The results so far Prof Olesen - a former GP himself - said the changes have not led to a ""flooding of the system"" by more GP referrals but better organisation of how patients are diagnosed within existing resources. Importantly, he says it has also led to better survival rates. ""We've got very optimistic results showing Norway, Sweden and Finland are becoming better year by year,"" he said. ""But very clearly in the data Denmark is becoming better, a faster pace than before and catching up and getting closer to where we should be."" Denmark has a similar health system in how it is funded and organised to Wales. He said there could be lessons shared between Wales and Denmark on how better organisation can help ""in catching up the elite in Europe"". Dr Tom Crosby, medical director of the Wales Cancer Network, said he had been impressed with how the Danish health service had broken down the barriers between GPs and specialists to work better together. He said: ""People are not just doing tests in isolation - they are working together to achieve a diagnosis.""","The passage describes a new approach to cancer diagnosis in Denmark, which was implemented to address poor cancer survival statistics compared to other European countries. The key elements of the summary are:

1. A team from Wales visited Aarhus, Denmark, to learn about their healthcare model, which was revamped due to alarming cancer survival rates over 15 years ago.
2. The problem identified was long waiting times for diagnosis, particularly for patients with vague or difficult-to-diagnose symptoms, and those needing quick tests or scans to rule out serious illnesses.
3. The new Danish model introduced three diagnostic routes:
   a. Fast-track routes for patients with ""alarm"" symptoms of specific cancers, with strict time targets.
   b. Diagnosis centres established in 2007 for patients with undiagnosed symptoms, providing quick tests and scans to determine the cause, whether cancer or otherwise.
   c. ""Yes-no"" centres for patients with minor symptoms unlikely to be cancer but requiring quick assessment to identify rare cases of serious disease.
4. The changes have not resulted in an overwhelming increase in GP referrals but have improved the organization and efficiency of the diagnostic process within existing resources.
5. The results have been positive, with Denmark showing improved survival rates and catching up to other Scandinavian countries.
6. The Danish system, similar to Wales in funding and organization, offers lessons for Wales in improving cancer diagnosis and treatment through better coordination between GPs and specialists.

In essence, the passage outlines Denmark's successful reorganization of cancer diagnosis pathways to improve efficiency, reduce waiting times, and enhance survival rates, with potential lessons for Wales' healthcare system.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.97494,0.85181,0.98234,1,1.0

"Management body NHS Employers has given the plan the green light after advisers said there were a range of extra tasks they could do with more training. A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs. But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS. It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rotas, while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors. NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-strong workforce could be reshaped to help. The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting. These included: The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages, such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care, with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them. It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff, but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened. Are nurses the new doctors?

And NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer said: ""Our challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report.""

""It takes doctors many years to learn how to provide the best care for their patients, and there is no substitute for this kind of expertise and experience,"" he said. ""There should be more staff support for doctors to help them coordinate the best possible care for their patients.""

"Barry Pring, 47, was killed by a speeding car as he tried to hail a taxi on the hard shoulder of a dual carriageway in Kiev in 2008. His wife, Ganna Ziuzina, had returned to a restaurant for a missing glove. The coroner at Exeter County Hall, Dr Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. More on the millionaire 'murdered' by his wife, and other news She said: ""His guard was lowered by inebriation. The car had stolen licence plates and did not brake or stop. ""I am satisfied that having heard all the evidence... much of it circumstantial, nevertheless, in my view it is overwhelming. ""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barry John Pring has been unlawfully killed."" She said the case demonstrated the difficulty in investigating a case of a death abroad, adding: ""Our thoughts and condolences must go to the family who have endured years and years of distress and unhappiness."" Close friend Peter Clifford, a lawyer, told the inquest he had ""no reasonable doubt"" that Barry was murdered. Ms Ziuzina, known as Anna, was 19 years younger than her husband. She tried to claim his assets within days of his death. His family believe he was killed in a staged hit and run accident. The couple met online in 2006 and were married in 2007 following a four-day engagement. Mr Pring's mother, Irene Pring, said Ms Ziuzina claimed to be a teacher when the pair first met, but she was in fact a lap dancer and stripper. She said: ""We are sure Anna had some involvement in his death to inherit his money and property. ""I was quite surprised how cold she was with Barry. She did not lift a finger, she was a lazy thing."" The inquest heard Ms Ziuzina sold her husband's Range Rover, contents from his flat and moved funds from his bank account. The hearing was also told she was ""entitled to the first Â£200,000 of his estate"" and that computer records revealed ""she was having an affair with a Ukrainian man"". Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said ""strenuous attempts"" had been made to get her to attend the inquest, but without success. In a statement, Ms Ziuzina said she had made ""three separate statements to Ukrainian police"" and did not believe she could ""add anything further"". Det Con Jonathan Watts, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said Mr Pring was hit by a car with no lights, speeding at 75mph. He also said witnesses at the scene in Kiev described the killing ""as a deliberate act"". The Ukrainian police closed an inquiry into his death, but relaunched it in 2011 as a murder inquiry. The case is still active ""but not actively pursued"".","Barry Pring, a 47-year-old millionaire, was fatally struck by a speeding car with stolen license plates on a dual carriageway in Kiev in 2008 while intoxicated and attempting to hail a taxi. His wife, Ganna Ziuzina, who was 19 years his junior, was absent at the time, returning to a restaurant for a lost glove. The coroner, Dr Elizabeth Earland, concluded the death was an unlawful killing, despite the challenges of investigating abroad. Barry's family suspects his death was a staged hit-and-run to allow his wife to inherit his wealth.

Barry and Ganna, also known as Anna, met online in 2006, married in 2007 after a brief engagement, and his family later learned she was a lap dancer and stripper, contrary to her initial claim of being a teacher. Following Barry's death, Anna attempted to claim his assets and was found to have sold his possessions, transferred funds, and had an affair. She was entitled to the first £200,000 of his estate. Despite efforts to involve her in the inquest, she did not participate, stating she had already made three statements to Ukrainian police.

The inquest heard that the car that hit Barry did not brake or stop, and witnesses described the incident as deliberate. Ukrainian police initially closed the case but reopened it as a murder investigation in 2011, which remains open but not actively pursued.

"It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud. The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented. However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice. One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option. The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before. They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app. If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase. They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out. While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service. That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker. Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's ""forensic"" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad. ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was ""the only one able to do that"". He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used. ""I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,"" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account. ""The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled."" However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system. ""The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,"" he said. ""And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back. ""Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies."" But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test. ""We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it. ""And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too."" Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it ""plans to more aggressively encourage people"" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords. ""When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,"" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper. ""I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.""","The passage discusses Apple's response to the unauthorized access of intimate celebrity photos from iCloud, which was likely facilitated by third-party software like Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker. Apple has introduced a two-step verification process for iCloud, which is an opt-in feature that adds an extra layer of security by requiring a four-digit code after the usual username and password on new devices. This code is sent to a trusted mobile phone or through the Find My iPhone app. Without this code, access to iCloud and purchases on Apple's digital stores is denied, although a recovery key is available for account access if the trusted device is lost or stolen.

Previously, two-step verification did not apply to Apple's back-up service, allowing attackers to download complete back-ups even if two-step verification was enabled. The recent changes by Apple prevent this by requiring the second step for back-up access as well. Vladimir Katalov, owner of Elcomsoft, confirmed that Apple's new measures effectively block his software's ability to access iCloud content.

Despite these improvements, concerns remain about the security of the recovery key, as it is difficult to remember and could be stolen or lost, potentially locking users out of their accounts. Some experts, like Prof Alan Woodward, argue that two-factor authentication should be the default setting rather than an opt-in feature, suggesting that this practice should be industry-wide.

Apple has acknowledged the need for better user education on security and plans to encourage the adoption of two-factor authentication and stronger passwords. CEO Tim Cook emphasizes the importance of awareness in preventing such security breaches.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.76287,0.93212,0.92994,1,1.0

"That report was never written, but the murdered opposition politician's colleagues, led by his close associate Ilya Yashin, have since worked to finish it. Most of the Russian-language report, entitled Putin. War, is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine. But its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends. Russia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, arguing that any Russians serving there are ""volunteers"". But Mr Yashin, who presented the report, said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk. ""All the separatists' key successes were secured by Russian army units,"" he said. ""The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory, admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation. There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident."" The dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine. A Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (Â£1,250-1,900) a month. Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles (Â£665m; $1bn): Boris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year, after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation. But those relatives never went public and, after his assassination, have become even more scared. Names and numbers of military units are documented, along with photos of weaponry, although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken. How many Russians are fighting in Ukraine? BBC team attacked while investigating soldiers' deaths Russian families look for soldier sons Mr Yashin said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies. But publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said. And above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia? There are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev. But the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity. In this, they admit he was successful. And it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov. Critics of Mr Putin praised Mr Nemtsov's reports on corruption in the president's entourage and on the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. But they failed to galvanise protests against him.","1. The report on President Vladimir Putin's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, initially started by the murdered opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, was completed by his colleagues, led by Ilya Yashin. The report, titled ""Putin. War,"" compiles facts from Russian and foreign media since the annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the outbreak of conflict in eastern Ukraine.

2. The report argues that Putin is waging war in Ukraine for his own benefit, highlighting the human and economic costs of the conflict. It accuses Russia of sending regular troops and armor to support rebels in eastern Ukraine, despite Russia's consistent denials, claiming any Russians serving there are ""volunteers.""

3. Yashin presents evidence that Russian soldiers and equipment were crucial in securing major victories for the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk. Testimonies from Russian army veterans indicate that they were directed to fight in Ukraine under the command of Russian generals, not separatists, and were compensated with significant salaries.

4. The dossier details the expenditure on the conflict, estimated at 53 billion roubles, and includes names, numbers of military units, and photos of weaponry. However, verifying this information is challenging without context for the photos.

5. The report faces distribution challenges, with many publishers fearful of handling the material. The initial print run is only 2,000 copies, and there is skepticism about the public's interest in learning about the conflict, given the availability of information on the internet and in liberal media.

6. While some Russians are aware of their country's involvement in Ukraine and find it justifiable, the opposition condemns Putin for orchestrating the war to bolster his popularity, which they acknowledge has been successful.

(Perhaps Mr Jones doesn't think Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year - Labour has pledged to maintain EU funding levels on regional aid beyond 2020). Some in Whitehall think the way EU money has been spent in Wales - check out Nick Clegg's film from Ebbw Vale - is an argument for transferring those powers to Westminster, but that looks politically less likely now.

"Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. “Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?” This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.","The passage reflects on the introduction of the iPhone and its profound impact on technology and society. The author recalls the initial challenge of reporting on the iPhone shortly after its unveiling by Steve Jobs, and how they managed to showcase the device on camera by borrowing one from Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller. The author's reporting was both lauded and criticized, with some viewers complaining about the extensive coverage of the iPhone launch. Despite initial skepticism about the iPhone's revolutionary potential, the author acknowledges that the smartphone has indeed transformed daily life, affecting industries and enabling over two billion people to access powerful computers.

The passage highlights the iPhone's role in changing photography, with the author contrasting a poorly focused photo taken with a digital SLR camera at the iPhone launch with a clear, high-quality photo taken a decade later using an iPhone. This comparison illustrates the iPhone's impact on making photography more accessible and instantaneously shareable.

The author credits Steve Jobs with recognizing the importance of an attractive user interface to encourage widespread use of smartphones for activities beyond calling and texting. The passage concludes by affirming the iPhone's historical significance as the catalyst for the mobile connected era, despite the author's initial reservations about the hype surrounding its launch. The author also notes that other companies like Amazon and Google are now leading innovation with products featuring artificial intelligence, building upon the foundation laid by the iPhone.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.90158,0.91776,0.97531,1,1.0

"No demos on the streets of Athens - even though the Syriza government is poised to agree and implement yet more austerity and liberalisation measures, mandated by creditors and of the ilk that till recently it characterised as hateful. And Greece's resorts are teeming: Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington (home of the IMF). Maybe holidaymakers were hoping to be on the ground for euro break-up history. Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State. But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition? Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â‚¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country. Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year. Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (""there is no alternative""). What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity. Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend. Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me). There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people. So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead. Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half. So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.","1. Despite the Syriza government's impending agreement to further austerity and liberalization measures, which they previously opposed, there have been no demonstrations in Athens.
2. Greece's tourism is booming, with Athens airport expecting 25 million arrivals this year, an increase from 21 million the previous year.
3. The lack of protests may be due to the anticipation of the full extent of concessions Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will make to secure a €86 billion bailout from the eurozone and the IMF.
4. The Greek population's relative calm could be attributed to the recent economic crisis in July, which may have convinced them of the necessity of the bailout terms, embodying the principle of TINA (""there is no alternative"").
5. Tsipras remains popular despite reneging on his anti-austerity platform and the worsening economic conditions, including a credit crunch due to the partial closure of banks.
6. The new bailout's success hinges on Tsipras's ability to inspire hope for better economic times, which may require creditors to reduce Greece's debt by a significant amount, potentially up to a third or a half.
7. To facilitate a genuine recovery, the EU, particularly Germany, should refrain from triumphalism and provide substantial debt relief alongside the new bailout terms.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.80065,0.93513,0.9679,1,1.0

"French firm EDF, which is financing most of the £18bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset, approved the funding at a board meeting. Contracts were to be signed on Friday. But Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the government will ""consider carefully"" before backing it. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz has cancelled a trip to Hinkley Point on Friday following Mr Clark's comments. Critics of the plan have warned of environmental damage and potential escalating costs. They are also concerned that the plant is being built by foreign governments. One third of the £18bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors. Hours after EDF's board voted to approve the £18bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project. This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact. EDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished. Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy? Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible. ""We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies,"" he said. ""Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments."" Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was ""yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties"". Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement. Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as ""a unique asset for French and British industries"", saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment. However, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity. Despite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners. Earlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise €4bn (£3.4bn) to help pay for the project. Ahead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was ""very risky"" financially. Earlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself. 5,600 workers on site at peak 4,000km electrical cabling 230,000 tonnes of steel 5.6m cubic metres of earth to be moved Environmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: ""Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money. He added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, ""doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians"". The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind. Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mix Mar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approved Oct 2013 - UK government agrees £92.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the time Oct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn.","The French energy company EDF has approved the £18 billion funding for the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project in Somerset, England, despite the UK government's decision to review the project before giving its backing. The project, which is expected to provide 7% of the UK's electricity, has faced criticism over environmental concerns, potential cost overruns, and the involvement of foreign governments, with one-third of the funding coming from Chinese investors. EDF's approval came after a board meeting, with contracts initially set to be signed the following Friday. However, the UK's Business Secretary Greg Clark announced a further review, surprising EDF executives and causing EDF's CEO to cancel a scheduled trip to the site.

The project has a troubled history, with EDF's financial stability being a major concern, leading to the resignation of its finance director earlier in the year and a board member just before the investment decision, both citing financial risks. To finance the project, EDF has raised €4bn through issuing new shares.

The UK government's delay has been seen as a significant setback for the project and Anglo-French relations, especially in the post-Brexit context. Industry representatives have urged a swift decision from the government to avoid energy supply issues and higher costs for dirtier power, which could jeopardize climate commitments. The decision to review the project has also been criticized by the EEF manufacturers' organization as another delay in a series of uncertainties.

Despite the controversy, EDF has described the plant as beneficial for the French and British nuclear industries and a boost for employment. Environmentalists, including Greenpeace, have condemned the project as poor value for money and have advocated for more investment in renewable energy sources like offshore wind.

The timeline of the Hinkley Point project includes the UK government's proposal for nuclear energy in 2006, approval of construction in 2013, agreement on a strike price for electricity in 2013, an investment agreement with a Chinese corporation in 2015, and the EDF board's final investment decision in July 2016, which was followed by the UK government's postponement of its final decision until autumn 2016.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.60731,0.85967,0.89237,1,1.0
"The newly-designed form, used to apply for a divorce in England and Wales, asks for the name ""of the person your spouse has committed adultery with"". Family lawyers say that, in most cases, involving a third party adds ""conflict and complexity"". The Ministry of Justice said there was ""no obligation"" to name people. Lawyer Margaret Heathcote, vice-chairwoman of family law group Resolution, is one of those concerned about the form. ""Generally speaking, we don't name the third party. It increases the conflict from day one,"" she said. ""There's no need. But because the box is there, the indication will be to fill it in."" The online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice. The guidance on the form highlights that it is ""not normally necessary"" to name the person your spouse committed adultery with. But Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers, Vardags, said people are ""unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it"". The older version of the form left a space for so-called ""co-respondents"" to be named where appropriate. ""The new form flatly asks for 'the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with',"" Ms Hamblin explained. ""This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse."" If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case. They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs.

""Unreasonable behaviour"" accounted for 46,815. Ms Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery ""want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them"". ""But it puts the petitioner in a bad light. We have to talk clients down from doing that,"" she said.

""As set out in the previous form, and more clearly in the new form, there is obviously no obligation to do so. This is a relevant part of divorce proceedings.""","The passage discusses the updated divorce application form in England and Wales, which includes a question asking for the name of the person with whom a spouse has committed adultery. Family lawyers, including Margaret Heathcote from Resolution, express concern that naming a third party can escalate conflict and complexity, despite the Ministry of Justice stating there is no obligation to provide this information. The new online form aims to simplify the legal process, but lawyers like Georgina Hamblin from Vardags caution that individuals might not heed the guidance that it is generally unnecessary to name the third party. Naming the third party can lead to them being involved in the court case, potentially causing delays and additional costs if they fail to respond. In 2015, there were over 100,000 divorces, with adultery accounting for 12,148 cases, compared to 46,815 cases of unreasonable behavior. Hamblin notes that most clients want to involve the new partner in the proceedings, but this is often discouraged by lawyers as it can reflect poorly on the petitioner and is viewed negatively by judges.

"They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy ""sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment"". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as ""sexier"" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. ""There's a huge market for our timber.

"HM Inspectorate of Probation found delays in getting offenders to start their work, and said too many were let off if they did not attend. In one case, an offender had completed just 16 hours in the 17 months since he had been sentenced. The Ministry of Justice said it was acting on the report's recommendations. Anything from 40 to 300 hours of unpaid work - or ""community payback"" - may be given for offences like shoplifting, theft, drug offences, or criminal damage. Some 70,000 offenders were ordered to do unpaid work such as garden maintenance, decorating or litter-picking in 2014. Inspectors looked at 100 cases and interviewed 86 offenders from different probation divisions for their report. The report outlined 15 recommendations for improvement. Some of the problems identified were: Seven years ago the government, then led by Gordon Brown, placed an order for 10,000 orange bibs. They were to be worn by offenders doing unpaid work under a re-branded scheme known as ""community payback"". It was intended to give the public confidence that community sentences, involving clearing communal paths and gardens, picking up litter and painting over graffiti, were a ""tough"" alternative to imprisonment. When the coalition came to power in 2010 it promised to make unpaid work more physical and intense, with unemployed offenders required to complete their sentences more quickly. The difficulty has always been organisation. Getting people who lead chaotic lives - many of them with drink or drug problems - to work on time is a task in itself. If sanctions are applied, they will end up in prison; if not, the sentence cannot be enforced. As the inspection report reveals, it is a problem the authorities still have not solved. Inspectors did praise instances of high-quality work, and cases where offenders believed they had gained skills from using good tools and equipment. They also highlighted that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and ""were determined to... desist from future offending"". Among its recommendations were that community rehabilitation companies should reduce how often offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time, and to try to create objectives for unpaid work that ""match the circumstances of the offender"". The chief inspector of probation, Paul Wilson, said it appeared in most cases that unpaid work was viewed simply as a punishment, which was a ""wasted opportunity"". ""Although we found some high-quality management and delivery, much of it was simply not good enough, lacking in focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court."" He called for ""urgent remedial action"". A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it wanted ""much more effective rehabilitation"" - which had to start with making sure offenders turned up on time and faced consequences if they did not. ""It's totally unacceptable for offenders to skip work enforced by the courts. ""We accept all the recommendations for the Ministry of Justice in this report and are already taking action to implement them.""","1. The HM Inspectorate of Probation reported significant delays in offenders starting their court-ordered unpaid work, with some offenders not being penalized for non-attendance.

"The paper ran a front page headline calling the comedian a ""hypocrite"" because he campaigns for economic and political ""revolution"" to help poorer people, yet he lives in a luxury home. It's an accusation often made against the star. How can such a rich man claim to speak up for the poor? Viewers of Brand's vlogs - The Trews - are familiar with the inside of his spacious London home. It looks lovely and airy. It has wooden floors and exposed brickwork. When the St Trinian's star was outside the prime minister's Downing Street home - supporting a campaign by residents of an east London estate who fear they will be turfed out of their homes to allow richer renters to move in - Brand was asked about his own accommodation by a TV reporter. ""Part of the problem is the super-rich buying property in London, isn't it? What kind of rent are you paying?"" Brand wasn't very happy with the question. He called the Channel 4 News journalist ""a snide"", before walking off. Newsbeat contacted Brand to see if he was really going to take legal action against The Sun and its owner Rupert Murdoch. He didn't reply, though he has been tweeting about The Sun and it's accusations of hypocrisy - using the hashtag #TheSunLogic. The star's been condemned as a hypocrite plenty of times before. Here's how he's explained it in the past. ""Don't think I'm unaware of the inevitability of such a charge. I know, I know. I'm rich, I'm famous, I have money... There is no doubt that I as much as anyone have to change. ""Revolution is change. I believe in change, personal change most of all. Know, too that I have seen what fame and fortune have to offer and I know it's not the answer. ""Of course I have to change as an individual and part of that will be sharing wealth, though without systemic change, that will be a sweet, futile gesture."" ""I can't deny that I've done a lot of daft things while I was under the capitalist fugue, some silly telly, soppy scandals, movies better left unmade. ""It's easy to attack me, I'm a right twerp, I'm a junkie and a cheeky monkey, I accept it, but that doesn't detract from the incontrovertible fact that we are living in a time of huge economic disparity and confronting ecological disaster."" ""Now I'm rich and I complain about inequality they say I'm a hypocrite. I'm beginning to think they just don't want inequality on the agenda because it is a real problem that needs to be addressed."" ""A system that has posited me on a lilo made of thighs in an ocean filled with honey and foie gras'd my Essex arse with undue praise and money. ""The hypocrisy ... is a problem that can be taken care of incrementally.""

Brand's lavish lifestyle, often showcased in his vlogs, contrasts with his public support for those facing displacement due to gentrification. When confronted by a TV reporter about his own housing situation, Brand reacted negatively and avoided the question. Despite the accusations, Brand has not shied away from addressing the issue on social media, using the hashtag #TheSunLogic. Although he has been criticized for hypocrisy before, Brand acknowledges the need for personal change and the redistribution of wealth, while also emphasizing the importance of systemic change to address economic disparity and ecological issues.

"The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community. Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. ""Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,"" he was once quoted as saying. And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts. But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process. After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form. Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science. Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict. As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive. This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted. ""Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,"" he said. During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes. But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough. Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally. He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates. His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work ""any monkey"" could do. The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research. And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis. His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme. Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles. Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure. In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal. But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt. The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins. The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that. ""I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,"" he said of the synthetic microbes. ""If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.""","Dr. J Craig Venter, a biologist and entrepreneur, played a pivotal role in accelerating the human genome mapping process by turning it into a competitive race, an act for which he was both praised and criticized. Despite his lack of modesty and luxurious lifestyle, his contributions to genomics are significant. After mapping the human genome, he embarked on creating a synthetic life form, Synthia, which was detailed in the journal Science by his institute.

Born in 1946, Venter's early life did not suggest a future in science; he initially preferred surfing to studying. His service in the Vietnam War as a naval hospital orderly during the Tet Offensive inspired him to pursue medicine and value time urgently. He excelled in research at the National Institutes of Health and recognized the potential of gene decoding. Frustrated with the slow pace of traditional methods, he adopted an automated decoding machine and then focused on the active parts of the genome, using RNA as a shortcut to rapidly produce gene sequences.

Venter's approach was controversial; James Watson criticized his work, and Venter left the NIH to establish his own research institute. In 1995, he sequenced the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae. His company, Celera Genomics, aimed to sequence the human genome in three years, challenging the established ten-year public project. Both efforts published their findings in 2001.

Venter's disregard for scientific conventions, such as open access to data, drew criticism but also financial success, allowing him to pursue science independently. In 2006, he founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which created the first synthetic life form. Venter has also been involved in oceanic research, collecting and sequencing marine microbes to understand gene and protein evolution better.

The creation of synthetic microbes has been met with controversy, but Venter believes they could lead to a new industrial revolution by reducing oil dependency and addressing environmental issues like carbon capture.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.81107,0.97036,0.98313,1,1.0
"Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else.

""School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet."" Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: ""Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. ""From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat. ""School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.""

"In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the ice fields slipping down Mont Blanc and the surrounding mountains of the European range covered some 375 sq km. By the late 2000s, this area had fallen to about 275 sq km. The research has been presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists. It mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations, but predominantly Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, France, and Italy. The new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gardent, from the University of Savoie, and colleagues. It assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, as well as the famous Mont Blanc Massif in the north. The team drew upon map archives, past satellite imagery and aerial photographs.  Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct. ""We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,"" explained Ms Gardent. ""Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins."" The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km. By 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows. Since then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s. This represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif. ""The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,"" Ms Gardent emphasised. ""We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud."" The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Efforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region. At this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk","1.

"People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) wants the mascot to be replaced with a modern animal-friendly version. The group has suggested a fish with the slogan Skegness - A Happy Plaice. The mayor of Skegness said all suggestions were welcome but said he did not think there would be much support for Jolly to be axed. The original Jolly Fisherman poster was commissioned by the Great Northern Railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to Skegness. The poster featured the slogan ""Skegness is so bracing"". It was commissioned in 1908 for 12 guineas and has became synonymous with the Lincolnshire resort. However, Dawn Carr, of Peta, said Jolly ""evokes images of cruelty to animals"". ""Fish being tricked into impaling themselves in the mouth, animals being pulled out of the ocean in giant nets where they are so crushed together the pressure pushes their stomachs out through their mouths and their eyes pop out."" ""This is what the Jolly Fisherman represents,"" she said. She said Peta's suggestion would give the resort an opportunity to rebrand itself as a progressive holiday destination. ""One where the mutilation and killing of sea animals is not being celebrated."" Skegness's mayor, Carl Macey, said the Jolly Fisherman was loved by adults and children alike. He said: ""Animal cruelty is something we don't want to be portrayed for, but I don't feel Jolly has ever come across in that manner. ""He is just accepted as happy and friendly and he does such a wonderful job for Skegness. ""It [Peta's suggestion] will go before council, but if it isn't broken we won't try and fix it.""","1. Peta has proposed replacing the Skegness mascot, Jolly Fisherman, with a more animal-friendly version, suggesting a fish with the slogan ""Skegness - A Happy Plaice.""
2. The Jolly Fisherman was originally created in 1908 for the Great Northern Railway to promote Skegness as a seaside destination, with the slogan ""Skegness is so bracing.""
3. Dawn Carr from Peta argues that the Jolly Fisherman symbolizes cruelty to animals, referencing the suffering of fish caught in nets.
4. Peta believes that rebranding with their suggested mascot would position Skegness as a progressive holiday destination that does not celebrate the harming of sea creatures.
5. The mayor of Skegness, Carl Macey, is open to suggestions but notes that Jolly is a beloved figure and does not believe he represents animal cruelty. He states that Jolly is seen as happy and friendly and does not think there is a need to change the mascot.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. ""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. ""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.

"It also warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal.Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign.The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations.The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain.This dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June.Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway.However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry.Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it ""must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations"".What complicates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states. The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states.""A successful industry,"" the report says, ""therefore needs continued market access.""However, that access may come at a price.""Brexit will involve many trade-offs,"" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee.""It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs.""The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states.One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away ""raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes"" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.However, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.Just this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns.Responding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.""With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,"" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement.""This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.""In response to the report, a government spokesperson said: ""As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market.""""At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.""Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook","1. The passage discusses the potential impact of Brexit on the UK fishing industry, which strongly supported leaving the EU due to dissatisfaction with the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).
2. The House of Lords European Union Committee released a report highlighting the risks and opportunities for the UK fishing industry post-Brexit, emphasizing that the industry should not be marginalized in negotiations despite its small contribution to GDP and limited employment.
3. The report notes the importance of market access for UK fish exports, primarily to the EU, and the possibility that the UK may need to allow EU boats to fish in UK waters to maintain tariff-free access to European markets.
4. It suggests that some aspects of the CFP should be retained after Brexit, and that the UK will still need to cooperate with neighboring states due to international obligations and shared fish stocks.
5. The report raises concerns about the potential for different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland if the CFP framework, which currently treats the UK as one entity, is dismantled.
6. Despite concerns, the fishing industry remains optimistic about Brexit, viewing it as an opportunity to regain control over UK waters and improve sustainable fisheries management, which could benefit coastal communities.
7. The EU's recent agreement on new quotas under the CFP, which includes increases in allowable catches for certain species, is seen by some industry representatives as a positive sign for the future of British fishing outside the EU.

"The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. ""Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,"" he was once quoted as saying.And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.""Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,"" he said.During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work ""any monkey"" could do.The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.""I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,"" he said of the synthetic microbes.""If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.""","The passage provides a comprehensive overview of Dr. J Craig Venter, a prominent biologist and entrepreneur known for his role in the human genome mapping race and his subsequent work in synthetic biology. Despite facing criticism from the scientific community for his competitive and commercial approach, Venter's contributions have significantly accelerated genomic research.

Key points from the passage include:

1. Dr. Venter's competitive and sometimes controversial approach to science, including his use of automated sequencing machines to speed up gene decoding, which was a major breakthrough in the field.
2. His transition from a lackluster student to a determined medical professional, influenced by his experiences in the Vietnam War, where he developed a sense of urgency and a commitment to making the most of his time.
3. Venter's shift from traditional DNA sequencing to focusing on messenger RNA, which allowed him to sequence genes more rapidly and contributed to his success in genomics.
4. The establishment of The Institute for Genomic Research after leaving the NIH due to funding issues and criticism from established scientists like James Watson.
5. The founding of Celera Genomics with the goal of sequencing the human genome in three years, which was seen as a direct challenge to the publicly funded Human Genome Project.
6. The completion of the first genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, and the subsequent publication of the human genome, which brought Venter both acclaim and criticism.
7. Venter's financial success and the creation of the J Craig Venter Institute, which led to the development of Synthia, the first synthetic life form, announced in the journal Science.
8. His ongoing projects, including the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling Expedition, which aims to sequence the genomes of marine microorganisms to enhance our understanding of gene and protein function and evolution.
9. Venter's vision for synthetic biology to potentially lead to a new industrial revolution by producing cells that can help reduce our reliance on oil and mitigate environmental damage by capturing carbon dioxide.

In summary, Dr. J Craig Venter is a transformative figure in genomics and synthetic biology, whose bold and often polarizing methods have led to significant scientific advancements, including the rapid sequencing of the human genome and the creation of synthetic life. His work continues to influence various fields, from medicine to environmental science.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.80566,0.18444,0.19025,1,1.0
"Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns.It says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects.The Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to ""drive up standards"".The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved.The study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level.The report cites figures that suggest  apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems.Only 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels.The report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330.The report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work.And it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship.In his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were ""poor"".The attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said.""Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society,"" he said.He said the ""cruel deception"" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop.The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.Sir Peter said: ""Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.""Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice.""England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs.""Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: ""Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do.""The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved.""The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved.""A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.""Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job.""We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month.""","The Sutton Trust reports that many apprenticeships in England are of low quality and too short compared to those in other European countries. The trust advocates for the creation of thousands of high-quality apprenticeships to enhance the economy and improve youth employment prospects. The Department for Education acknowledges the need for reform to elevate apprenticeship standards.

A study by the Boston Consulting Group for the Sutton Trust reveals that out of 520,000 apprenticeship starts in England each year, fewer than 200,000 are at level three, equivalent to A-levels. In contrast, Germany, with a respected vocational education system, has a higher proportion of quality apprenticeships, with 90% at A-level equivalent and significantly more apprenticeships offered by employers. England's system is complex, with 18,000 qualifications compared to Germany's 330.

The report highlights that since 2010, over half of apprenticeships have been below level three, with most aimed at those over 25, and there is fierce competition among young people for available apprenticeships. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, criticizes the low value of many vocational qualifications in England and calls for an end to the ""cruel deception"" of the current apprenticeship system.

The report recommends expanding apprenticeships to 300,000 new starts each year, with the majority at level three or above, and a cap on level two apprenticeships at 10%. Sir Peter emphasizes the importance of apprenticeships for social mobility, equivalent to university degrees.

Teresa Frith from the Association of Colleges acknowledges the challenge of creating more apprenticeships and the value of some level two apprenticeships. The Department for Education spokeswoman affirms ongoing reforms to ensure apprenticeships are rigorous and meet employer needs, including a minimum duration of one year and a focus on English and maths skills.

"Last weekend, the country was declared free of the virus that killed almost 4,000 people in the country over the past 18 months.He told the BBC's Richard Hamilton about his experiences in the civil war, which ended in 2002, and his Ebola work:I had a normal family life before the war started in 1991.But at 15 I was kidnapped by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and taken to the jungle where I was trained on how to use a gun and initiated into the group.I thought it was the end of my life. It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.They used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.It seems like a nightmare now.I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.If they said: ""We don't have food"", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.Sometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.I lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.Fortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.He encouraged me saying: ""You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.""At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.Through this so many lives were saved.There were three key activities.We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.We educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.Thirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.People were frightened.Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.It was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.We didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.Now I see my life as a changed person.I regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.We are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.If we invest in them then we are building the future.11,314Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)4,808 Liberia3,955 Sierra Leone2,536 Guinea8 Nigeria","The passage recounts the personal experiences of an individual in Sierra Leone who was kidnapped by rebels during the civil war that ended in 2002. At 15, he was forced to join the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), where he faced brutal initiation rituals, threats, and witnessed extreme violence. He managed to escape and, with the help of a preacher named Richard Cole, found hope and a purpose in rebuilding the nation. Richard Cole's project, Lifeline Nehemiah, provided him with education and support, instilling in him the importance of contributing to society.

When the Ebola crisis hit Sierra Leone in 2014, he and his team, despite not being medical professionals, were driven by a passion to make a difference. They engaged in three key activities: educating over 10,000 people about the reality of Ebola, providing food and support to thousands, and establishing an Ebola treatment unit in collaboration with other agencies. Their efforts saved many lives, even as they faced initial resistance and fear from the community.

The individual reflects on his transformation from a perpetrator of atrocities to a community leader, expressing regret for his past actions but optimism for the future. He emphasizes the importance of investing in young people to change the world.

The passage also provides statistics on the impact of the Ebola virus, with a total of 11,314 deaths across several countries, including Liberia (4,808), Sierra Leone (3,955), Guinea (2,536), and a smaller number in Nigeria.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, announced his decision to extend his term by only one year, surprising many who thought he would either leave in 2018 as originally planned or stay until 2021. The decision was influenced by personal reasons, particularly his daughters' educational milestones in 2018, which made it an ideal time for his family to return to Canada. Despite speculation about political pressure or disillusionment with post-Brexit economic predictions, Carney emphasized that his decision was entirely personal and should not be interpreted as a commentary on government policy. Although Prime Minister Theresa May was keen for him to stay until 2021 and some criticized the Bank's pre-referendum forecasts, Carney felt that extending his tenure by just one year would allow him to see the UK through the initial Brexit negotiations while also considering his family's needs. By the time he steps down, the Article 50 process for Britain's exit from the EU should be concluded, and a new Governor will take over to navigate the country's economic future.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.93973,0.95455,0.97444,1,1.0

The programme includes interactive workshops that focus on emotional wellbeing, seeking help when distressed, and identifying support sources.

The initiative was piloted in five schools and is now intended to be expanded across Northern Ireland. It was launched at Carrick Primary School in Lurgan, County Armagh, where the pastoral care coordinator, Helen Hamilton, noted the anxiety among pupils and parents about moving to secondary school. Hamilton emphasized the importance of addressing children's social and emotional needs to ensure they are ready to learn.

The programme teaches children coping strategies such as breathing exercises and relaxation techniques. The need for such a programme is underscored by the stress associated with the unofficial transfer tests, which saw a slight increase in the number of entrants sitting the tests this year.

"The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections.It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999.It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time.APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan.The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja.The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo.It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency.However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub.The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east.Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory.Elections were not held in seven states.Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, AbujaThe APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.Why Jonathan lost?Buhari's historic victoryNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.","1. The All Progressives Congress (APC) secured 19 out of 28 governorships in the recent elections, marking the biggest loss for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since the end of military rule in 1999.
2. The PDP, which had previously lost the presidential election to APC leader Muhammadu Buhari, also lost governorships in key northern states such as Katsina and Kaduna, as well as in Adamawa, a state affected by Boko Haram's insurgency.
3. The PDP managed to retain control of Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub, and won eight governorships, mainly in the south-east.
4. The election results are still pending for Taraba, and the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive due to a high number of spoilt ballots.
5. Elections were not conducted in seven states.
6. The APC's victory has significantly reduced the PDP's influence, transforming it into a regional party with limited support outside the south-east and Niger Delta.
7. Despite the APC's national success, they failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, which could pose challenges for President-elect Muhammadu Buhari in managing oil production and revenue.
8. The elections were generally more peaceful than previous years, although there were instances of violence, particularly in Rivers and other southern states.
9. The APC's victory in Lagos state is historically significant as it aligns the presidency and the commercial capital under the same party for the first time since 1999.

The schools in question are Park View, Nansen Primary, Oldknow Academy, and Golden Hillock School, all of which were rated inadequate by Ofsted. The Park View Educational Trust, which runs some of these schools, may be removed from their management. A head teacher at one of these schools, referred to as the ""Trojan Horse"" schools, reported feeling isolated and undermined by parents and considered quitting before the Trojan Horse letter's contents became public.

Ofsted's reports, published after inspecting 21 schools, found issues with the schools' ability to keep students safe from extremism, improper vetting of external speakers, and the promotion of spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development. Birmingham City Council plans to work with the Department for Education to establish a temporary governing board for Saltley School, the only local authority school placed in special measures.

Education minister Lord Nash expressed deep concerns about the management of Park View School and decided to terminate its funding agreement, with a similar decision for Nansen Primary School. Both schools were given until 4 July to respond. Oldknow Academy and Golden Hillock School were also warned about the potential termination of their funding agreements unless they addressed concerns such as ending less favorable treatment of non-Muslims, ceasing segregation of boys and girls, and ensuring a broader curriculum.

The prosecution at Ipswich Crown Court has charged Honey Rose, a 35-year-old eye specialist, with gross negligence manslaughter, claiming that her professional conduct was significantly below the required standard to the point of being criminal. Ms. Rose, who resides in Newham, east London, has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

The core of the prosecution's case is that Ms. Rose failed to identify signs of swollen optic discs during Vinnie's routine eye test, which should have prompted a referral for further medical investigation. This alleged oversight contributed to a fatal build-up of fluid in Vinnie's brain, leading to increased pressure within his skull and ultimately resulting in his death. The prosecution argues that Vinnie's death could have been prevented if Ms. Rose had fulfilled her professional duties competently. Given the severity of the outcome and the standards expected of a qualified optometrist, the prosecution deems her conduct to be criminally negligent.

In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant.In order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition.The film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around.Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will ""help the public understand a little more about autism"".The film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism.The film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube.Alzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia.A Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition.Virtual meatballsVirtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections.In April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive.Gamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, ""not a typical Ikea customer"" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction.""In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action,"" she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London.""And what they wanted was meatball,"" she said.Meatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants.When meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: ""I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it.""""This is really talking to customers,"" said Ms Franov.Now the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look.Healthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias.Surgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital.Some 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour.Now the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately ""democratise medicine"".Meanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders.In one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation.In September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars.The kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK.Most pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they ""were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me"".Marcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills.

The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool,"" he said.At VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning.""One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required,"" he said.Cash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least.","1.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no ""magic bullet"" to cure defects in the system.It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet.""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.""The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"".He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""","The passage discusses the findings of a review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform regarding the council tax system in Scotland. Key points include:

1. The council tax has inherent issues that have been exacerbated by a lack of modification, leading to additional challenges for policymakers.
2. The commission, established by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will deliver its report later in the year.
3. Professor Kenneth Gibb from the University of Glasgow reviewed global local taxation systems and found that property taxes are common among OECD countries and are considered stable and effective, but they can be confusing for taxpayers who are unsure if they are wealth taxes or service charges.
4. The property tax is also seen as unfair by some because it is not tied to current income.
5. Local income tax is viewed as fairer but presents challenges for local authorities due to income fluctuations and limited ability to adjust rates according to local needs.
6. Professor Gibb concluded that there is no simple solution to tax reform, and any changes will be complex due to past experiences and the difficulties inherent in reform.
7. The commission plans to conduct a public consultation across Scotland before releasing its findings in the autumn.
8. The Scottish government considers the current council tax system to be unfair and, in partnership with local government, has set up the commission to explore more equitable alternatives.

"It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud.The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented.However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice.One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option.The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before.They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app.If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase.They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out.While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service.That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker.Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's ""forensic"" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad.ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was ""the only one able to do that"".He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used.""I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,"" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account.""The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled.""However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system.""The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,"" he said.""And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back.""Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies.""But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test.""We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.""It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it.""And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too.""Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it ""plans to more aggressively encourage people"" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords.""When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,"" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper.""I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.""","The passage discusses Apple's response to the unauthorized access of intimate celebrity photos from iCloud, which may have involved third-party software like Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker. Apple has introduced a two-step verification process to enhance security, which requires users to enter a four-digit code sent to a trusted device in addition to their password when logging in from a new device. This feature, while previously available, is now being more aggressively promoted by Apple, though it remains an opt-in service.

The two-step verification now extends to iCloud backups, previously a vulnerability that allowed attackers to download complete backups even if two-step verification was enabled for account access. Apple has also implemented email notifications for when backups are downloaded.

Vladimir Katalov, owner of Elcomsoft, acknowledges that Apple's changes have effectively countered his software's ability to access iCloud content. However, he raises concerns about the recovery key, which can be lost or stolen, potentially leading to data loss or unauthorized access.

Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey suggests that two-factor authentication should be the default setting due to the vulnerabilities of single-step verification. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, recognizes the need for increased awareness about security measures and plans to encourage users to adopt stronger passwords and two-factor authentication. The passage concludes with a broader statement about the responsibility of tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Google, to prioritize user security by implementing two-factor authentication as a default setting.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.84704,0.9478,0.98326,1,1.0

The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass.""Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000).Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.""I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,"" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.""We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,"" said Snoussi.""But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium.""""But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. ""We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.""In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match.""Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.""Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,"" said Snoussi.""We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.""Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.","Tunisia narrowly avoided expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations after apologizing to the Confederation of African Football (Caf) for complaints they made during the 2015 tournament. The controversy arose when Tunisia was awarded a disputed penalty in the quarter-final against Equatorial Guinea, leading to a loss after extra time. Tunisia's football federation clarified that they did not accuse Caf or the referee of corruption but criticized the referee's performance and selection. The issue was resolved following a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou, ensuring Tunisia's participation in the 2017 qualifiers.

Morocco's participation in the 2017 Nations Cup qualifiers was secured after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned their ban and reduced their fine. Morocco had been banned from the 2015 and 2017 tournaments for refusing to host the 2015 event due to Ebola concerns, requesting a postponement instead. Fouzi Lekjaa, the Moroccan FA chief, expressed optimism for the future of Moroccan and African football, downplaying the impact of the ban. Equatorial Guinea replaced Morocco as the 2015 hosts with just 64 days to prepare.

"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points.This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid.Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentalityThe slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine.Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit.This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history.In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it.But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.","The passage provides a historical overview of McLaren's trajectory in Formula 1 (F1), highlighting their past successes and current challenges. McLaren has an impressive record with 182 grand prix wins, a 23.18% win rate, 12 drivers' world championships, and 8 constructors' titles. Despite their current struggles, they boast two world champions in their lineup, including Fernando Alonso, who is considered by some to be the best driver on the grid.

McLaren's decline began in 2013 due to issues with chassis design, compounded by problems with the Honda power-unit. This contrasts with their previous successes, particularly in the late 1980s and 1990s, when they dominated F1, winning 15 out of 16 races in 1988 with drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. They experienced a resurgence in 1998-99 with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines, securing their last constructors' title in 1998.

The team faced setbacks in 2007 and 2009 due to scandals, including being stripped of their constructors' championship and a $100m fine for possessing Ferrari's technical information, and the 'lie-gate' scandal, respectively. Despite occasional race wins, titles eluded them after 1999, with the exception of Lewis Hamilton's championship in 2008.

McLaren's history has been characterized by cycles of triumph and decline, with their first decade focused on building a competitive team. They achieved their first title in 1974 with Emerson Fittipaldi and another in 1976 with James Hunt. A significant downturn followed, prompting Ron Dennis to take control and lead them to dominance in the 1980s and 1990s.

Despite their current predicament, McLaren's leadership, including Ron Dennis, remains optimistic, believing that success will return and that they will challenge Mercedes' dominance in F1. Fernando Alonso's return to McLaren in 2015 was based on his faith in the team's potential to win another title, particularly with the Honda partnership. The team is confident that their car is competitive and that Honda will improve their engine, expecting to deliver multiple championships in the future. However, as of now, they are in a period of belief and anticipation, with much at stake for both the team's legacy and Alonso's career.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.66069,0.53541,0.29629,1,1.0

There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.""The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.""Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.""Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).""The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.""","1. Cuadrilla has suspended shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking,"" after a 1.5 magnitude tremor, the second in two months, occurred near Poulton-le-Fylde.
2. The British Geological Survey (BGS) reported that the recent tremor had a similar location and mechanism to an earlier one on 1 April.

4. Fracking involves fracturing shale rocks deep underground to release gas, using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions.
5. Mark Miller, CEO of Cuadrilla Resources, emphasized the company's commitment to safety and responsibility, stating they have ceased operations to consult with authorities and experts.
6. Environmental concerns have been raised about fracking, particularly in the US, where there are allegations of gas leaks into drinking water supplies, potentially causing tap water to ignite.
7. The UK's Commons energy select committee has recommended that the government support fracking, suggesting that environmental issues seen in the US can be mitigated with strict regulation and industry best practices.
8. The BGS is monitoring seismic activity related to fracking as a precautionary measure.
9. Two minor earthquakes have been recorded in Lancashire since fracking operations began in March, including the most recent one on Friday.
10. The BGS's analysis of the April quake indicates that injecting pressurized water into rocks can cause fractures and potentially trigger earthquakes, which is a known side effect of oil extraction and geothermal engineering processes, including shale gas extraction.

"carriers of the brca1 gene , like hollywood star angelina jolie , can reduce their risk of death once they have been diagnosed with breast cancer by having their ovaries removed
women diagnosed with breast cancer caused by the gene carried by angelina jolie could be helped to beat the disease if they have their ovaries removed as she did .
a study indicates that following the example of the hollywood star cuts their risk of dying from breast cancer by more than 60 per cent .
miss jolie , 39 , had the procedure , known as an oophorectomy , in march .
two years before , she had a double mastectomy as she carries the brca1 gene variant which dramatically raises the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer .
women who carry a mutated version of brca1 or another gene known as brca2 face a life-time risk of breast cancer of up to 70 per cent .
if diagnosed , they face a severe threat of ovarian tumours .
the researchers in canada analysed 676 breast cancer patients who had one of the mutated genes , nearly half ( 345 ) underwent oophorectomy after their diagnosis .
the study found the 20-year survival rate for the entire group was 77.4 per cent .
having an oophorectomy was associated with a significant drop of 62 per cent in breast cancer death in women with a brca1 mutation , but this did not occur in those with a brca2 mutation .
there were nine deaths from ovarian cancer in the women who did not have oophorectomies .
the scientists found a 65 per cent reduction in death from all causes associated with oophorectomy .
according to the study , oophorectomies were performed an average of six years after breast cancer diagnosis .
for the 70 brca1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years , there was a 73 per cent reduction in death compared with women with the mutation who never underwent the procedure .
the authors , writing in the journal jama oncology , said that the protective effect of oophorectomy against breast cancer was apparent immediately after diagnosis and lasted for 15 years .
dr steven narod , of the women 's college research institute , toronto , called for follow-up studies on women who undergo oophorectomy as part of their initial treatment , in particular , those who had the surgery within a year of finding out they have breast cancer .
he added that more research was needed , especially on carriers of the brca2 variant .
journal editor dr mary disis said the results were ` compelling and suggest the potential of oophorectomy should become part of the treatment discussion at the time of diagnosis for brca mutation carriers with early stage breast cancers ' .
she added : ` the results provide a validation of oophorectomy in coveying both a disease-free and overall survival benefit for brca1 carriers .
` in the entire group , oophorectomy was particularly effective for survival benefit in women with oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer . '
those women diagnosed with the brca1 gene mutation have a 50 to 80 per cent risk of developing breast cancer , pictured , in their lifetime
women with a significant family history of breast cancer may have an increased risk of getting the disease .
a significant family history is defined by :
women who inherit the faulty , or mutated , brca1 or brca2 genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime .
genetic tests are available to women who are likely to have a brca1 or brca2 mutation , or faults in two other genes called tp53 and pten .
brca gene faults are more common in the ashkenazi jewish population , about 2.3 per cent of ashkenazi jewish women have a brca gene mutation .
this type of the disease affects about one in four women diagnosed with breast cancer .
it is an especially aggressive form which is often resilient to drug treatment and requires intensive chemotherapy .
other studies of the gene mutation carriers have found that reduced mortality is associated with ovary removal for women with a history of breast cancer .
speaking about her decision to have the procedure miss jolie , who has six children , said that having her ovaries removed did not make her feel any less womanly .
in an article for the new york times , she wrote : ` i feel feminine , and grounded in the choices i am making for myself and my family . '","The passage discusses the benefits of oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) for women with breast cancer who carry the BRCA1 gene mutation, similar to the situation of actress Angelina Jolie. Key points include:

1. Women with the BRCA1 gene mutation can significantly reduce their risk of dying from breast cancer by having an oophorectomy, with a study showing a more than 60% decrease in breast cancer death rates.
2. Angelina Jolie, a BRCA1 carrier, underwent an oophorectomy in March and a double mastectomy two years prior to reduce her cancer risk.
3. The study, conducted in Canada, analyzed 676 breast cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and found that those who had an oophorectomy after diagnosis had a 77.4% 20-year survival rate, with a 62% reduction in breast cancer deaths for BRCA1 carriers.
4. The protective effect of oophorectomy was immediate and lasted for 15 years, with a 73% reduction in death for BRCA1 carriers who had the surgery within two years of diagnosis.
5. Oophorectomy also reduced the risk of death from all causes by 65% and prevented ovarian cancer deaths in the study group.
6. The study suggests that oophorectomy should be considered part of the treatment discussion for BRCA mutation carriers with early-stage breast cancer.
7. The procedure was particularly beneficial for women with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer.
8. BRCA1 carriers have a 50% to 80% risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime, with the mutation being more common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
9. Genetic tests are available for women with a significant family history of breast cancer to detect BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PTEN gene mutations.
10. Angelina Jolie shared that the procedure did not diminish her sense of femininity or womanliness.

The passage emphasizes the importance of considering oophorectomy as a treatment option for BRCA1 mutation carriers diagnosed with breast cancer, as it significantly improves survival rates and reduces the risk of death from the disease.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.96713,0.82262,0.9812,1,1.0

"a mother of a baby boy was arrested 27 years after his body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a sainsbury 's bag floating on a village pond .
police exhumed the boy 's body from his grave in norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review .
a dna sample eventually led them to his mother .
the woman , who has not been named , was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends .
she explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of weasenham st peter on june 5 , 1988 , just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a sunday afternoon outing .
unsolved case : a police officer searches windmill pit , the norfolk pond where the baby boy 's body was found back in 1988
the boy 's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review , with dna samples leading police to the boy 's mother .
he has now been reburied at weasenham st peter church , norfolk
police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the cps decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial .
during the original investigation , police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby 's burial at 13th century st peter 's church in the village .
a report in the eastern daily press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond
but after the body was exhumed in april last year , dna taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents .
detectives examined that person 's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy 's mother .
a police spokesman said : ` in this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation .
` thanks to advances in dna we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself .
` sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play . '
det insp andy guy , of norfolk police who led the investigation said the dna was compared to five million samples on the national database .
he said : ` it came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age .
` we went to see that individual and she told us she was mum .
she was arrested on suspicion of infanticide .
` we were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her .
` the pregnancy was concealed from everybody .
she did n't tell her family , her close friends , she gave birth in secret .
the baby was stillborn . '
the woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond , known locally as windmill pit , before it was found by a group of teenagers .
the boy was originally buried without a name but a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as peter after the name of the church
a second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play .
an inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death .
the baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on june 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named peter after the name of the church .
det insp guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time .
he added : ` this has been unsolved for 27 years .
by using the latest techniques , we 've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time . '
` we do n't ever give up .
all the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they 're reviewed at regular intervals . '
det insp guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had ` mixed feelings ' after bringing the investigation to a final close .
he said : ` from a police officer 's perspective , it 's fantastic .
from a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her . '
the grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross , which read : ` in loving memory of unknown baby boy .
born and died 1988 . '
a support group called hana 's gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as peter .
the inscription reads : ` in loving memory of baby peter , june 1988 .
a sweet little child , lost but then found , to bloom and grow in heaven 's playground .
there is no foot so small that it can not leave an imprint on the world . '
tranquil : the pond in the village of weasenham st peter , norfolk , as it is today
karen murray-tye who set up hana 's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006 , said : ` it was quite hard to find the right words , but i thought the ` lost but found ' fitted the circumstances .
` i hope she sees we 've tried to do the best for him as we have for hana .
it would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward . '
norfolk coroner 's chaplain chris copsey said : ` when the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said ` unnamed baby boy ' .
` it seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so i took the name of the church , st peter 's church . '

but when mr hicks objected , the driver continued on for almost a mile , leading him to jump from the vehicle while it was travelling at more than 20mph .
he suffered devastating brain injuries , developed epilepsy and now requires round-the-clock care from his mother .
mr hicks ' family , from bath , took driver mr young to the high court ( pictured ) , where a judge ruled he had unlawfully imprisoned his passenger
mr hicks ' family , from bath , took mr young to the high court .
there , mr justice edis ruled the driver had unlawfully imprisoned mr hicks , who was therefore entitled to damages .
the exact amount of compensation is yet to be decided - but is set to be around 50 per cent of what the family had requested and thought to be ` hundreds of thousands of pounds ' .
speaking on behalf of the family , lawyer james davies said : ` this was a terrible incident in which kristopher suffered a very severe brain injury leaving him needing care for the rest of his life .
` the latest judgement agrees that kristopher is entitled to a settlement to provide specialist rehabilitation and care which will help maximise his progress . '
mr hicks , who was 23 at the time of the incident , had gotten into the taxi with his girlfriend abigail noad at orange grove taxi rank in bath to his home in the foxhill area , according to high court documents .
in a police interview , mr young said he had become suspicious after hearing ms noad joke that the couple were not going to ` do a runner ' .
deciding the issue of liability , the judge said mr young mistakenly decided mr hicks was not going to pay the fare on november 2 in 2010 , adding there was no basis for him to think so .
the driver had decided to take mr hicks back to the rank to cause him as much inconvenience as possible .
mr hicks , who found himself being unlawfully driven off by a stranger into the night , decided he should try to escape .
mr justice edis said : ` the end result is that the claimant decided to jump out of the taxi at a dangerous speed .
i do not know why he did this .
` it may have been that he misjudged the speed and thought it was safe to do so , but the true motive will never be known . '
he said had mr hicks jumped out when it was stationary at lights there would be no permanent damage .
mr hicks had gotten into the taxi at the orange grove rank in bath ( pictured ) in 2010 with his girlfriend
` i have broadly accepted the evidence of the defendant and therefore find that his intention was not to do anything other than to return him to the rank where he would be released , ' he added .
` this is the kind of conduct which creates a significant risk to life and limb as this case demonstrates . '
the judge said it was a ` stark and unattractive choice ' to decide between the two - and concluded there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the damages payable to mr hicks .
he was also entitled to a further £ 250 for unlawful imprisonment .
lawyers representing mr hicks said the incident left him with ` devastating ' brain injuries and he is now being cared for by his mother gill .
speaking at the time the claim was lodged with the high court , james davies , said : ` whilst he has undergone extensive treatment and rehabilitation , he has developed post-traumatic epilepsy , headaches , fatigue , suffers social and behavioural problems and has no sense of taste or smell .
` he is reliant on 24-hour care from his mum and is unable to work . '
both sides were given permission to appeal and a further hearing will determine the amount which mr young will have to pay .","27-year-old Kristopher Hicks was severely brain-injured after jumping from a taxi driven by Michael Young, who mistakenly thought Hicks was going to leave without paying. Hicks was on a night out with his girlfriend in Bath, Somerset, when the incident occurred. Young, a former soldier, attempted to teach Hicks a lesson by driving him back to the taxi rank, but Hicks jumped out of the moving vehicle, which was traveling at over 20mph, resulting in his injuries. Hicks now requires constant care from his mother and has developed epilepsy.

Hicks' family took Young to the High Court, where Mr. Justice Edis ruled that Young had unlawfully imprisoned Hicks, entitling him to damages. The compensation amount is yet to be finalized but is expected to be around 50% of what the family sought, likely hundreds of thousands of pounds. The judge acknowledged the severity of Hicks' injuries and the need for a settlement to fund his rehabilitation and care. Despite Young's intention not to harm Hicks, his actions created a significant risk, leading to the reduction of damages by 50% and an additional £250 for unlawful imprisonment. Both parties have been granted the right to appeal, and a future hearing will determine the exact compensation Young must pay.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.7,0.9658,0.99467,1,1.0

the light general aviation aircraft approaches the aero acres residential airpark and touches down without its landing gear deployed
he states that the landing gear has not been deployed and at that very moment the plane touches down with a bump and scratches along the tarmac .

suddenly the pilot re-engages the engines and rather unceremoniously takes off back into the air .
the plane 's propellers can be heard ricocheting off the ground as the wings bounce up and down from the impact
the video maker can be heard saying that the plane 's propellers have been damaged in the collision with the runway and that more than likely , the pilot will crash .
he later said : ` i was walking down the flight line of aircraft that flew in for the day , which is close to the main runway and noticed this light twin aircraft coming in low .
` i noticed he did not have his landing gear down and thought he was going to do a fly-by , but then noticed the power was pulled back with the aircraft approaching for a landing with no landing gear .
the plane scratches along the runway and the video maker describes the sound as ` one you will not forget '
` the belly and tips of the propellers impacted the runway ( the sound of the propellers hitting the surface was one sound you will not forget ) .
` once the pilot realized his mistake , he gave what appeared to be full throttle and both propellers pulled the front of the aircraft down with the propellers making a second impact with the runway .
` somehow the engines stayed on and running and the pilot was able to regain control while leaving the airport .
the video maker noted that once the pilot realized his mistake he began re-engaging the engine
he added : ` it 's amazing the aeroplane engines did not get destroyed during the propellers impact and the pilot did not stall during the forced take-off with the high angle of attack and damaged propellers . '

another cause is mechanical fault , when an electric motor or a hydraulic actuator fails .

"a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped .
domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra .
in february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence .
but today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn .
sentence dropped : domenico rancadore ( right and left ) fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in italy for his role as a ` man of honour '
although his conviction remains intact , italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed .
the case will still have to be heard by the italian supreme court , according to the crown prosecution service ( cps ) .
rancadore 's solicitor , karen todner said : ` yesterday the italian court of appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of domenico rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence .
` i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings .
` there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . '
ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore .
once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it .
the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court .
domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped
rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 .
although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 .
known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ` mafia association ' .
he was convicted for his role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo .
during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition .
in his judgment , judge riddle said : ` i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . '
before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view .
he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe .
rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted .
before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge
there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case .
extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ` what a waste of time and money .
after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . '
mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ` the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment .
` it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence .
` so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : "" hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request "" .
` courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme .
` it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying .
` had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . '
domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra
asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the ` single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' .
barrister philip marshall qc said : ` yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . '
there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today .
curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway .
one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ` you never know who will move in ' .
she went on : ` he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . '
the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health .

today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn
sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ` they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple .
` they are very quiet .
i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street .
also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ` our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct .
groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ` clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection .
most of the clans are led by a ` boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) .
only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges .
it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than € 10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money .
politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections .
the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy .
` he 's very quiet .
he always has been , even before it all blew up .
they are a very quiet family . '
federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ` when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse .
` that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire .
` it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . '
mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ` useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 .
a cps spokesman said : ` the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court .
` it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome .
` until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . '
the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year .
at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .","Domenico Rancadore, a fugitive member of the Sicilian mafia known as the ""Godfather of Uxbridge,"" will be allowed to remain in the UK after his sentence was effectively nullified. Rancadore, who had been living in Britain for over 20 years, was originally sentenced to seven years in prison by an Italian court in 1999 for his association with the Cosa Nostra. Despite losing his battle against extradition in February, it was discovered that his case had expired last October due to Italian law, which states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed.

Although his conviction remains, the Italian Court of Appeal agreed to extinguish Rancadore's conviction on the grounds that it was too old to sustain a prison sentence. His lawyer, Karen Todner, expressed confidence that the Italian government would withdraw the European Arrest Warrant and that Rancadore would be discharged from the proceedings.

but ritter told the tennessean , last year it was a decision she now regrets .
` i have never seen a close-up photo and i want to .
i 'm going to . '
she had declined to see the photos for several decades , and not even after barrett was convicted 33 years later .
but last year she asked mickey miller , metro police lead investigator who worked on the case if she could see them .
she says he tried to convince her not to see them , but she persisted and she viewed them on his laptop .

cookies were scattered around the clothed body .
a neck bone was fractured .
the case was nashville 's most notorious unsolved murder for 33 years .

he was 15 at the time of the crime .
barrett , 68 , was living in memphis when he was arrested in 2006 .

the match happened after he was arrested for the 1975 murder of vanderbilt university student sarah vannatta des prez .
barrett had been in prison on sex charges between 1974 and 2002 except for about a year when marcia disappeared .
in 2009 he was found guilty of second-degree murder of marcia and a davidson county criminal court jury imposed a sentence of 44 years .","40 years after the murder of her daughter Marcia, Virginia Trimble Ritter recently viewed crime scene photos of her daughter's body, which she had previously avoided seeing at the advice of her then-husband. Marcia was raped and choked to death by Jerome Sidney Barrett in 1975, and her body was found 33 days after her disappearance. Despite Barrett's conviction 33 years later and a sentence of 44 years imposed in 2009, Ritter's decision to view the photos last year led to a visceral reaction; she expressed a desire for revenge upon seeing the graphic images of her daughter's brutalized body. Marcia's murder remained unsolved for decades, with an initial suspect, a neighbor who was 15 at the time, charged and then released due to lack of evidence. Barrett, who had a history of sex charges and had been in and out of prison, was eventually linked to the crime through DNA evidence after his arrest for another murder.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.73991,0.7939,0.91721,1,1.0
"rory mcilroy believes it is ` unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam .
and the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at augusta national in 2011 was the most important day of his career .
mcilroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus and tiger woods .
rory mcilroy tees off at the arnold palmer invitational golf tournament in orlando on march 19
` for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland .
` there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year .
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions .
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome .
it would just be incredible .
` you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much .
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . '
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round .
mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month
but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket .
` during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added .
` if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time .
if i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed .
` and not just one .
i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on .
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . '
mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel .
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year .
mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added .
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much .
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot .
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position .
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out .
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . '
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february .
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to caroline wozniacki
and he hopes he can again use the golf course as his ` sanctuary ' from the pressure and hype surrounding augusta .
` the golf course was my sanctuary , it was where i could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that i am out there and it helped .
it really did , ' he added .
` i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen .
` i know i wo n't be able to wait until thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the golf course and play golf .
there is only so much you can talk about it and then you have to go out and try and play . '","Rory McIlroy, the world number one golfer, is determined to win the Masters at Augusta National to achieve the career grand slam, a feat accomplished by only five other players in history. The 25-year-old considers his final-round collapse at the 2011 Masters, where he led by four shots but finished with an 80, as a pivotal learning experience that propelled him to win his first major at the U.S. Open shortly after. McIlroy has since won three more majors and views the Masters as a significant milestone in his career. He believes that winning at Augusta would solidify his status as a complete player, capable of conquering different golf courses and conditions. Despite only one top-10 finish at the Masters, McIlroy is confident in his ability to win multiple green jackets and considers it almost unthinkable not to win at least one in his career. He plans to use the golf course as a sanctuary to escape the pressure and hype surrounding the event, as he did during his successful 2014 season despite personal and legal distractions. McIlroy is focused on playing his best at the upcoming Masters, hoping to join the exclusive group of golfers who have won all four major titles.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.40354,0.30894,0.10074,1,1.0

"hundreds of children were admitted to hospital last year after being born brain damaged following exposure to alcohol in the womb , alarming new figures have revealed .
in total , 272 youngsters left disabled by foetal alcohol syndrome were hospitalised in england over the past 12 months , according to data from the official health and social care information centre .
but the actual number affected by their mother ' s drinking could be far greater , experts have warned .
warning : new figures show that 272 youngsters left disabled by foetal alcohol syndrome were hospitalised in england over the past 12 months , according to the official health and social care information centre
research by the world health organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the uk could suffer learning , behavioural and physical problems such as deformed limbs because of exposure to alcohol , according to the sunday people .
that equates to about 7,500 every year .
elizabeth mitchell , of the national organisation for foetal alchol syndrome , told reporter nicola fifield : ` children born with the syndrome do n't get better .
` it is an enormous problem and one that is terribly sad and vastly under-diagnosed . '
tip of the iceberg : research by the world health organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the uk could suffer learning and behavioural problems because of exposure to alcohol in the womb
one teenager who was born with foetal alcohol syndrome is 15-year-old niamh brown .
she needs help getting dressed , has no sense of danger and will never be able to live independently .
niamh was three when her adoptive parents julia and simon first noticed something was wrong .
she stuggled at playschool , having difficulty holding a pencil and paying attention .
two years later , at the age of five , niamh was diagnosed with foetal alcohol syndrome from her birth mother 's drinking .
in 2007 , julia and simon set up the foetal alcohol spectrum disorder trust to help others .
other medical issues associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy include problems with the liver , kidneys and heart , cerebral palsy , sight loss and epilepsy .
pregnant women are advised by the government not to drink alcohol .
if they do , the maximum consumption recommended is up to two units no more than twice a week .
but ms mitchell believes the guidance should be changed so that women are advised not to drink at all during pregnancy .","272 youngsters in England were hospitalized in the past year due to disabilities caused by fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition resulting from exposure to alcohol in the womb. This figure is considered to be the tip of the iceberg, as experts believe the actual number of children affected is much higher. The World Health Organization (WHO) research indicates that at least one in every 100 babies born in the UK may suffer from learning, behavioral, and physical problems due to prenatal alcohol exposure, which could mean around 7,500 affected babies annually.

Elizabeth Mitchell from the National Organization for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome emphasizes the severity and under-diagnosis of the condition, noting that children with FAS do not improve over time. A case in point is 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who requires assistance with daily activities, lacks a sense of danger, and will never live independently due to FAS. Her adoptive parents noticed developmental issues when she was three and she was diagnosed at age five.

FAS can lead to a range of medical issues, including liver, kidney, and heart problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. Current government advice is for pregnant women to limit alcohol consumption to no more than two units, up to twice a week, but there are calls for the guidance to be revised to recommend complete abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.97688,0.57864,0.90193,1,1.0

the four men appeared in turn in a courtroom in dartmouth , near halifax , where they were given identical but unusual bail conditions that could see them having to live on a canadian naval base for the next few years .
bail was set at over £ 2,000 for each of them but they also agreed to surrender their passports and live at the nearby stadacona naval base in halifax .
accused : joshua finbow , 23 , a submarine engineer from stockbridge , hampshire , arrives at court today
two of the accused , simon radford , 31 , of gosport , hampshire and craig stoner , 24 , from stonehouse , gloucestershire hid their faces as they were led to a provincial court in dartmouth , nova scotia
darren smalley , 35 , of gosport , hampshire , and his co-accused were ordered to surrender their passports as part of their bail conditions
in a deal agreed with the british government , they will also continue to work for the royal navy and draw their current pay .
it was not clear last night how they will keep themselves occupied thousands of miles from their shipmates and a representative from the british high commission who was in court refused to elaborate .
the four -- joshua finbow , 23 , a submarine engineer , craig stoner , 24 , simon radford , 31 , and darren smalley , 35 -- had been playing for the royal navy ice hockey team in a tournament at the shearwater naval base just east of halifax .
the alleged sexual assault , in which police sources say all four men had sexual intercourse with their victim , took place on april 10 after the sailors had returned to the barracks from a hockey game .
sources say their victim , who is aged in her early 20s and lives in halifax , had accompanied a friend who had been invited to attend the party by local canadian servicemen .
yesterday , all four men -- three of them wearing black royal navy ice hockey team hoodies -- looked relieved to be getting out of custody as they respectfully answered judge john macdougall 's questions .

they were ordered to return to court on may 27 and given the names of seven people -- the victim and six witnesses -- who they were forbidden to contact .
they must not leave the province of nova scotia and can not apply for new passports .
they must remain employed by the navy and must not resign without the court 's permission .
the four , no longer trying to hide their faces , later filed out of the court building and were driven away together in a large white suv to their new home on the close stadacona base .
they ignored a question over how they might plead in the case .
commander michael o'sullivan , the air and naval advisor at the british high commission , has spoken to the four and described the alleged offences as ` serious ' but stressed they were as yet only allegations .

as soon as rj was born , mrs jackson , from las vegas , knew there was something wrong with her son , after noticing a red rash spreading across his tiny chest
they reported fears mrs jackson had been abusing rj .
` it just shows the extent of people 's ignorance , ' mrs jackson , from las vegas , said .
the 35-year-old said she is also subjected to taunts in the street , with other mother 's accusing her of burning rj .
` his skin is bright red and shiny , ' mrs jackson added .
` i put vaseline all over him two to three times a day to keep his skin subtle but he is still sore .
` when he was younger he had to have it over his body every few hours -- even in the night .

` he 's got a cheeky smile and an adorable giggle . '

` we 've had the police called for child abuse .
` we were in walmart in las vegas putting his creams on when we were surrounded by five armed police .
netherton 's syndrome is a rare congenital skin disease - a more extreme form of ichthyosis .
sufferers ' skin appears red and scaly and can also experience hair , infection and allergy problems .
because red skin can be attributed to several diseases , the condition may not be accurately diagnosed until later in a child 's life .
most children with the disease appeared ` scalded ' at birth and are slow to gain weight .
their skin quickly loses heat , water and protein and babies are often kept in incubators on special care baby units as a result .
they are more at risk of infection because of their inflammed skin .
parents are advised to reguarly cleanse and moisturiser their child ` skin , while taking care when holding them .
there is no cure for the condition , but in most infants , the symptoms improve with time .
as they get older , a child 's skin may remain red and scaly , and their skin may be itchy , sensitive or raw , sometimes appearing thicker at the joints .
the condition appears out of the blue where there has been no family history .
but , it is thought to be genetic , and parents can carry the faulty gene responsible .
` their guns were n't drawn .
the officer asked what was going on .
i explained and he apologised .
` but it just shows the extent of people 's ignorance . '
mrs jackson , who is married to rj 's father reginald , 40 , said their son was diagnosed when he was a baby .
` after an emergency caesarean , i knew something was n't right , ' she said .
` as rj was lifted up and i saw him for the first time , i noticed an angry rash on his chest .
` he was rushed to intensive care where the rash seemed to spread before our eyes , his skin becoming even redder and cracking . '
she said her first thought was he was being burnt by the incubator light .
` but he was n't , ' she said .
` no one had any idea what was wrong with him .
` when doctors told me i could take him home two weeks later , i burst into tears .
` i did n't think he was well enough to leave hospital .
his skin was crusty and starting to fall off .
` back home , as he cried and screamed , i felt helpless , and wished there was something i could do .
` he 'd scratch at his skin until it bled , so i put socks on his hands to stop him .
` i searched the internet for answers but i could n't find anything . '
she eventually stumbled upon a facebook group called netherton 's syndrome research group .
it had been set up by a couple in the uk whose child , jack oldacres has the condition .
` each symptom was exactly like rj 's , ' mrs jackson said .
` people from all over the world were sharing stories , swapping tips to help one another .
` i knew this was what he had .
i found out netherton 's was a rare strain of the skin condition ichthyosis , affecting one in 200,000 births in the uk .
mrs jackson was desperate to discover what was wrong with rj , centre on his sister 's lap , and so turned to the internet .
there , she found a facebook group set up by the parents of a little boy with the disease .
` each symptom was exactly like rj 's , ' she said .
` i knew this was what he had '
` reginald and i started slathering rj 's skin in vaseline every three hours , like people on the group suggested .
` we bathed him just twice a week because the hard water dried out his skin too much .
` each time i 'd sit with him in the bath and painstakingly remove all the dead skin . '
but , she said , people are still critical of her .
` i 'm happy to explain what netherton 's is , but most people jump to conclusions before i get the chance , ' she said .
` his brother and sisters are great with him , always helping out and standing up for him .
` just like any other little boy , he loves throwing around a ball and is usually bubbly and happy , until his skin starts to hurt .
` right now , rj is too young to know that people make nasty comments , but i hope as he grows , his condition will be better known .
` it does n't matter how red his skin is , all i see is a beautiful little boy . '","Valerie Jackson, a mother from Las Vegas, has a four-year-old son named RJ Jackson who suffers from Netherton's Syndrome, a rare skin condition that affects only 70 people worldwide. The condition causes RJ's skin to appear red, inflamed, and scaly, often mistaken for burns or abuse. Valerie regularly applies creams to manage RJ's skin dryness and discomfort.

Despite her efforts to care for her son, Valerie has faced public accusations of child abuse, including an incident where armed police confronted her while shopping with RJ due to a report from a stranger. She also endures verbal abuse from people in the street who accuse her of harming RJ. The family has been denied access to public places like play centers, and RJ has been subjected to bullying, mostly from adults.

Netherton's Syndrome is a form of ichthyosis, characterized by red, scaly skin that can lead to heat, water, and protein loss, as well as increased risk of infection. The condition is genetic and can appear without a family history, with symptoms typically present at birth. While there is no cure, symptoms often improve with age, though the skin may remain sensitive and itchy.

Valerie discovered RJ's diagnosis through an online support group after struggling to find information about his symptoms. The group, which included parents of another child with Netherton's Syndrome, provided valuable advice on managing the condition. Despite the challenges, Valerie remains dedicated to her son's care and is hopeful that awareness and understanding of his condition will grow as he gets older. She sees beyond his skin condition and focuses on the beauty and joy of her son.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.39764,0.84182,0.95379,1,1.0
"campaigners against the new protein world ` are you beach body ready ? '
adverts are celebrating today after learning that they are being taken down .
transport for london ( tfl ) has revealed that the controversial posters around the london underground , featuring a bikini-clad model called renee somerfield are being removed .
the sight of the 24-year-old 's toned figure towering above train platforms has caused a stir among feminists and body image campaigners - a change.org petition calling for the adverts to be pulled has already attracted more than 50,000 signatures .
one of the many protein world posters on the london underground that have been defaced
several of the images have also been defaced by bloggers , angry at the perceived insinuation that only women who look like renee are ready to go to the beach .
the advertising standards authority has also received more than 200 complaints from people saying that the adverts promote an unhealthy body image .
but today , tfl confirmed that it was pulling the posters down , because they had come to the end of the three-week advertising period that protein world had paid for .
the company also said it had taken note of the reaction from customers to the advert and that they would bear it in mind if they received a request to put up posters of a similar nature in future .
the posters are now being removed from the london underground
a tfl spokesperson told mailonline : ` this advertisement will begin to be removed from our network as scheduled from tomorrow .
` we have received one complaint about it and we will be guided by the committee of advertising practice ( cap ) and advertising standards authority ( asa ) if a similar advert were to be submitted again .
` we have zero tolerance towards graffiti on the network and take action to prevent it and remove it . '
the removal of the posters comes as a protest organised against protein world in hyde park on may 2 gathers steam - hundreds of people are expected to attend the rally in central london .
the posters have caused a huge backlash on social media , with thousands of tweets directed at the campaign .
one user called catrin stewartwrite : ` you clearly know what you 're trying to sell with that offensive , unrealistic and sexist advert . '

online fitness store protein world , who claim that the image is entirely unphotoshopped , have been actively engaging in the furore on social media , strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved tweeters .
` we are a nation of sympathisers for fatties , ' a spokesperson for protein world tweeted to one user after she signed the change.org petition calling for the removal of the advert .
` why make your insecurities our problem ? '
tv presenter susanna reid described the campaign for protein shakes , which features a toned swimwear-clad model alongside the slogan ` are you beach body ready ? '
, as ` anxiety inducing ' during an interview with the fitness brand 's head of global marketing on monday morning .
the good morning britain presenter and her co-host ben shephard grilled richard staveley about the uproar surrounding the poster , which has attracted the wrath of many social media users .
many have been outraged that the advert appears to suggest women can not go on the beach in a bikini unless they look like the slim model in the advert .
` what if my only goal is to be on a beach ? '
, susanna asked richard , adding , ` am i irrational by finding that advert a little bit anxiety inducing ? '
weighing in on the debate : susanna reid revealed she found the controversial protein world advert ` anxiety inducing ' on good morning britain on monday
security threat : staveley revealed police were investigating a bomb threat made to the company
the protein world boss defended the campaign , saying : ` that may be but we are a fitness brand , our own aspirations are to make the nation healthier and ask each one of us to set our sights higher , to be fitter , to be healthier and actually have an inner and outer confidence within ourselves . '
the tv stars also addressed the company 's blunt responses to twitter complaints , including ` why make your insecurities our problem ' and ` grow up ' .
but staveley believes the reaction is justified , saying , ` there is an irrational minority who have decided to interpret it in that way . '
susanna , 44 , retorted : ` do you think everybody who objects to it is irrational ?
am i an irrational extremist ? '
defending protein world : richard staveley , head of global marketing , insisted the company 's advert was n't meant to offend and was targeted at health-conscious individuals looking to get fit in time for summer
the company boss revealed protein world has received ` threats on our head office , physical and violent threats ' .
he added : ` we had a bomb threat ... that 's been reported to the police .
it 's currently being investigated . '
staveley concluded his appearance on the itv show by declaring that it had been a ` fantastic campaign ' for the brand and they wo n't changing their advertising methods in future .
the advertising standards authority ( asa ) said it has received 216 complaints about the advert and is ` carefully assessing ' the complaints to ` establish if there are grounds for further action ' .
sales of protein powder - which can be priced up to £ 45 per kilogram tub - are rocketing in the uk , growing from £ 73m in 2007 to £ 170m in 2012 .
they are expected to reach £ 358m by 2017 , according to the market-analyst euromonitor , as gym-going brits add the stuff to post-workout smoothies and drinks in a bid to build muscle .
meanwhile , katie hopkins came to protein world 's defence , tweeting : ` chubsters , quit vandalising protein world ads and get your arse running on the road .
feminism is n't an excuse for being fat .
eat less , move more . '
and writer samantha brick , who is open about feeling confident about her looks , posted a provocative update on facebook : ` just ordered my size 8 yellow bikini for my beach hols in june .
i will be bikini ready .
* that * ad totally worked for me . '","The passage describes the controversy surrounding Protein World's ""Are you beach body ready?"" advertising campaign, which featured a bikini-clad model named Renee Somerfield. The campaign, particularly the posters displayed across the London Underground, sparked significant backlash from feminists, body image campaigners, and the general public. A Change.org petition to remove the ads garnered over 50,000 signatures, and the Advertising Standards Authority received more than 200 complaints claiming the ads promoted an unhealthy body image.

Transport for London (TFL) announced the removal of the posters, citing the end of the three-week advertising period that Protein World had paid for. Despite the controversy, Protein World defended the campaign, stating the image was unphotoshopped and that they were targeting health-conscious individuals. The company also engaged with critics on social media, sometimes with confrontational responses.

The campaign was widely discussed on social media, with many users expressing outrage over the perceived message that women need to look a certain way to wear a bikini. TV presenter Susanna Reid described the campaign as ""anxiety inducing"" during an interview with Protein World's head of global marketing, Richard Staveley, who argued that the company's goal was to encourage fitness and health.

Despite threats and a bomb scare reported to the police, Protein World declared the campaign a success and stated they would not change their advertising approach. The Advertising Standards Authority was assessing the complaints to determine if further action was necessary. The passage also notes the growing market for protein powder in the UK, with sales expected to rise significantly by 2017.

Public figures such as Katie Hopkins and Samantha Brick weighed in on the debate, with Hopkins criticizing those who vandalized the ads and Brick expressing that the ad motivated her to be ""bikini ready.""",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.75451,0.94156,0.9804,1,1.0
"rail firms came under fire this weekend for planning a series of fare hikes of up to 87 per cent just ten days after the general election - despite the main party leaders pledging to freeze prices .
the prime minister has requested first great western ( fgw ) ` urgently review ' its decision to almost double some fares on the route between london and the cotswolds - which passes through his witney constituency .
mr cameron has promised to freeze fares in real terms for the whole of the next parliament , while labour has also pledged to bring in a ` cap ' on price hikes .
sent letter : prime minister david cameron has written to first great western to request it ` urgently reviews ' plans to increase fares on trains running through his witney constituency
passengers travelling from charlbury , the oxfordshire station nearest to his constituency home , can currently purchase an off-peak return to london costing £ 33.30 .
this allows them to leave at 9.42 am , outside the morning peak , but return on one of the four services that go from london during the evening peak period .
but from may 17 , these customers will be forced to pay £ 62.40 if they want to come home on one of these trains - an 87 per cent increase .
the planned changes have angered mr cameron 's constituents - prompting him to personally intervene .
the prime minister 's spokesman told the sunday times : ` mr cameron has written to first great western and asked them to urgently review their decision . '
train companies have three windows every year in which they can increase ` unregulated ' fares , which make up around half of their total revenue .
unregulated fares can include journeys such as off-peak leisure and advance-purchase tickets .
first great western has insisted the reason for the change is to bring the north cotswolds route in line with its other services .
the firm is also offering some customers a cheaper option in advanced single tickets , potentially allowing them to buy a return for £ 20 if they book ahead .
other sharp price hikes to be introduced include an off-peak first-class single from crewe to northampton on london midlands , which will rise from £ 30 to £ 37 , according to trainsplit.com - a website that provides passengers with cheaper ticket options .
the cost of an anytime return between stafford and liverpool , travelling with virgin , will leap from £ 26.50 to £ 33 - a 24.5 per cent hike .
biggest hike : passengers travelling with the rail firm between london and the cotswolds could face increases of up to 87 per cent come may 17
and an anytime first-class day return on virgin from manchester to stoke will go up 22 per cent - rising from £ 29 to £ 35.30 .
virgin has said the ` vast majority ' of its price hikes affected ` virgin trains-only fares ' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms .
it added : ` our overall fare increase this year on the west coast is just 1.65 per cent , well below the industry average . '
speaking to mark hookham of the sunday times , mike richardson , of trainsplit.com , said : ` passengers might very well be surprised at these fare increases when both the main parties have talked about price freeezes .
hundreds of ` anytime ' and ` off-peak ' returns rose by 40 per cent in january .
its research found rail fare increases on tickets that passengers buy on the day and on rural routes .
defended rise : virgin has said the ` vast majority ' of its price hikes affected ` virgin trains-only fares ' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms","1. Rail companies plan to increase fares by up to 87% shortly after the general election, despite party leaders promising to freeze prices.
2. Prime Minister David Cameron has asked First Great Western (FGW) to urgently review its decision to nearly double some fares on the London to Cotswolds route, which affects his Witney constituency.
3. Cameron and the Labour party have pledged to freeze or cap fare increases.
4. FGW's fare hike would affect passengers traveling from Charlbury to London, raising the cost of an off-peak return ticket by 87% to £62.40.
5. Train companies can raise ""unregulated"" fares, which include off-peak and advance-purchase tickets, three times a year and these fares account for about half of their revenue.
6. FGW justifies the increase by aligning the North Cotswolds route fares with other services and offers cheaper advanced single tickets.
7. Other significant fare increases include a London Midlands first-class single from Crewe to Northampton and a Virgin anytime return between Stafford and Liverpool.
8. Virgin claims most of its price hikes are on ""Virgin trains-only fares,"" which are 20% cheaper than competitors, and its overall fare increase is 1.65%, below the industry average.
9. Mike Richardson of Trainsplit.com notes that passengers may be surprised by the fare increases given the political promises of price freezes.
10. The research indicates that ""anytime"" and ""off-peak"" returns have risen by 40%, with increases seen in day-of tickets and on rural routes.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.91371,0.92632,0.97983,1,1.0

a newlywed pensioner has been left blinded in one eye after being hit in the face with a brick hurled into his home by vandalising yobs .

when one brick smashed the glass , mr young went and opened his front door to remonstrate with the attackers only to be struck in his left eye by another brick .
he suffered an open wound to his forehead and a serious injury to his left eye and was taken to hospital .
however , despite undergoing emergency surgery , doctors were unable to save his eyesight meaning he is now blind in one eye .

the next minute we knew there was glass shattered all over the hall because a brick had hit the door .
` john opened the door and the man was standing there shouting ` come on , come on ' .
the next minute john is covered in blood .
` i just wish he had never opened the front door .
i had already called 999 and for him to go out was a mistake but it obviously was a natural reaction to what was happening .
` we do n't have any idea why it happened .
we feel like it must have been wrong place , wrong time .
john has never had trouble before and neither of us can understand why these people would do something as low as this .
` i have got a flat in southport so we are moving there now .
i do n't think either of us want to come back after what 's happened .
we are just too scared to live in this neighbourhood . '
detective constable gareth gwilliam , of greater manchester police , said the second brick was thrown ` directly ' at the man but would n't reveal how many offenders were involved in the incident .
he said : ` at this stage , there appears to be no known motive for this attack .
` it might be there is no motive other than the culprits were messing around and for whatever reason thought it would be funny to throw bricks at someone 's house .
the attack occurred just three weeks after mr young married his partner elaine , who he met just 14 months ago .
the couple are pictured on their wedding day at gretna green in dumfries and galloway , scotland

` however , there is absolutely nothing funny or clever about what they did and as a result of their wanton and reckless actions , this man has been left with a permanent disability and a loss of sight in one eye .
` understandably , he is a mixture of angry and devastated so we need to establish who was responsible for this senseless incident and bring them to justice .
` i would therefore urge anyone who saw anything , or if you suspect who may be involved , to call us immediately . '

by far the most expensive airport is haneda airport , also known as tokyo international airport , where planes are charged a whopping £ 4,559 ( $ 6,850 ) just for the privilege of landing .
welcoming almost 69million passengers a year , and still maintaining an incredibly high punctuality rating , it is perhaps understandable that fees can be high .
tokyo 's narita international airprot comes second , charging £ 3,728 ( $ 5,600 ) , while kansai international airport in osaka charges £ 3,594 ( $ 5,400 ) per landing .
number eight on the list of the most expensive airport landing fees is dublin airport at £ 2,729
somewhat surprisingly , the uk 's bristol airport makes it into the top 10 as the only british airport featured , charging £ 2,929 ( $ 4,400 ) per private jet landing , just behind toronto in canada and darwin , australia .
the only us airport to make it into the top 10 is laguardia , in new york , which charges $ 3,950 ( £ 2,630 ) for private jets arriving in the city .
other unexpected appearances in the top 10 also include dublin airport , in eighth place and salzburg , in austria , in 10th .","The passage discusses the significant variation in landing fees at airports for private jets, which is a concern for the wealthy individuals who travel by private jet. These fees provide insight into unexpectedly popular transport hubs among the rich and famous, including locations like Salzburg in Austria and Darwin in Australia. The private jet industry is lucrative, with 2.5 million private flights recorded in the U.S. and 705,000 in Europe, and is valued at $16.7 trillion in the U.S. and $15.8 trillion in Europe. Demand surges during major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl and the Monaco Grand Prix, leading to higher costs for private jet travel.

Private jet companies have quoted high prices for travel to such events, with round-trip costs from New York to the Super Bowl reaching around $38,000 to $54,000. For the Monaco Grand Prix, flights from London to Cannes or Nice are estimated at about £8,835 to £8,895.

The passage also lists the most expensive airports for landing fees, based on the 767-400 aircraft, which is often used for private travel. The top three most expensive airports are all in Japan: Haneda Airport charges £4,559, Narita International Airport charges £3,728, and Kansai International Airport charges £3,594. Other airports in the top 10 for high landing fees include Toronto Pearson International Airport, Darwin International Airport, Bristol Airport, and La Guardia Airport in New York. Dublin Airport and Salzburg Airport also feature on the list, with Dublin in eighth place and Salzburg in tenth. These high fees reflect the exclusivity and demand for these airports among private jet travelers.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.59725,0.77008,0.27688,1,1.0

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 2012 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","1. The upcoming fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao is anticipated to be the most financially significant fight of all time and the most important of this century.

he said : ` it really is vital that if any intelligence comes from the community that we look at it .","The passage reveals that rural areas in West Wales, specifically Ceredigion, Powys, and Pembrokeshire, are being used as training grounds for terrorists and for the radicalization of Muslims. Detective Constable Gareth Jones from the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit has highlighted that these terrorism-related activities are not limited to large cities and that individuals involved may participate in normal community activities with hidden agendas.

Historically, Islamic extremist activity in Wales dates back to at least 1998, with the claim that hate preacher Abu Hamza sent extremists to train in the Brecon Beacons in Powys. The area's challenging terrain is also used by the British military for training elite forces like the SAS. In 2005, two of the 7/7 bombers were seen white water rafting in North Wales, and in 2010, three men from Cardiff were arrested for plotting terror attacks in the UK inspired by Al-Qaeda.

Additionally, Michael Adebowale, one of the murderers of fusilier Lee Rigby, studied Arabic at the European Institute of Human Sciences in Highmead, near Llanybydder, which was reportedly established by Iraqi clerics. Other individuals, such as Omar Latif, Gurukanth Desai, and Abdul Miah, were found to have held secret meetings in a Welsh country park, further indicating the region's involvement in terrorist activities.

Detective Constable Jones emphasized to councillors the importance of community intelligence in combating terrorism, stating that radicalization training occurs in the mentioned rural areas and that those involved may appear to engage in ordinary activities while harboring ulterior motives. He stressed the need for authorities to act on any intelligence provided by the community.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.91093,0.77516,0.83123,1,1.0

"( cnn ) thinking about presidential candidates ?
apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider .
according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?
as cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : "" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .
in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .
i do n't support a woman being president . ""
"" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , "" rios wrote in a facebook post .
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .
throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .
studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .
if science does n't convince you , just google "" cheating politicians "" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .
rios has taken a lot of flak for her "" biblically "" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .
time magazine declared hillary clinton the "" perfect "" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is "" biologically primed "" to lead .
( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )
believe me , i wish i were .
no wonder jon stewart left "" the daily show "" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .
we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .
and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .
unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .
some people believe women have "" our place "" and that place is not at the table .
they 'll tell your daughter to "" go for it "" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .
in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .
the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as "" geniuses "" and the women as "" nice . ""
the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .
hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .
that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .
the fact is , equality benefits everyone .
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .
it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .
it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .
and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .
our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .
it 's not enough to say to our daughters : "" you can be anything you want to be . ""
what we need to say is : "" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . ""
rios said that if clinton is elected , she is "" moving to canada "" because "" a female should n't be president . ""
apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 2019 .
correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .","1. The passage discusses the issue of gender bias in leadership, particularly in the context of presidential candidates, with a focus on hormones as a factor in decision-making.
2. Cheryl Rios, CEO of Go Ape Marketing, expressed the belief that women should not be president due to their hormones potentially leading to irrational decisions, such as starting an unnecessary war.
3. This view is contrasted with the historical perspective that male hormones have sometimes impaired male leaders' judgment, and studies indicate that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks.
4. The passage notes that despite progress in gender equality, women still face significant bias in leadership roles, which is evident in both overt and covert ways.
5. The article cites examples of gender bias, such as the prevalence of men named John, Robert, William, or James on corporate boards compared to the total number of women, and the different ways male and female professors are described by students.
6. The passage argues that equality is beneficial for everyone, including better financial performance for companies with women in leadership, happier and healthier children with involved fathers, stronger marriages with shared responsibilities, and improved results from diverse teams.
7. The article also mentions that despite the bias, having more women in leadership roles and more men involved in household management would strengthen the nation, economy, and families.
8. The passage concludes by emphasizing the need to actively combat gender stereotypes and the importance of affirming to girls that they can achieve their dreams despite societal biases.
9. Rios' threat to move to Canada if Hillary Clinton were elected is mentioned, along with a correction noting that Kim Campbell was Canada's first female prime minister, not the current one as previously stated.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.76769,0.9341,0.98254,1,1.0

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .
the care assistant , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 66 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Leonie Granger, a 25-year-old care assistant and aspiring model from Gillingham, Kent, has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for the manslaughter of Mehmet Hassan, a 56-year-old professional gambler. Granger targeted Hassan after seeing him with a roll of £50 notes at a London casino. She used her looks to befriend him, gaining gifts, cash, and fancy dinners in return. Granger then set up Hassan for a robbery by leaving his flat door unlocked, allowing her boyfriend, Kyrron Jackson, and his accomplice, Nicholas Chandler, to enter and brutally attack Hassan, resulting in his death.

The attack was described as ""pitiless and wicked"" by Judge William Kennedy, who noted that it was a brutal act that defied reason and compassion. Although Granger was found not guilty of murder, she was convicted of manslaughter by a majority of 10 to 2. Her co-defendants, Jackson and Chandler, were convicted of murder and received life sentences with a minimum term of 36 years. They were also found guilty of additional charges related to armed robbery and false imprisonment.

During the trial, it was revealed that Hassan was unaware of the plot and had enjoyed several dates with Granger, whom he knew as ""Rachel."" On the night of the murder, after a lavish dinner and a visit to the Palm Beach Casino, Hassan was tied up, beaten to death, and robbed of his winnings by Jackson and Chandler, who had been waiting outside his flat. The attackers fled with £3,000, a TV, and Hassan's mobile phone, but were apprehended after Granger's phone records were analyzed.

Hassan's family expressed their ongoing grief and love for him after the convictions. The trial highlighted the victim's lifestyle, including his frequent winnings at casinos and his habit of keeping large amounts of cash in his flat, which made him a target for the unscrupulous. Granger's defense argued that she had been manipulated by Jackson, whom she loved, and that she deeply regretted her actions.

"it seems an accepted trend that chelsea midfielder cesc fabregas struggles during the second half of the season and the spanish midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country 's 2-0 defeat by holland on tuesday .
the 27-year-old spoke of his happiness in south west london earlier this week but his form has significantly dipped from that of the player who , around christmas , looked a dead-cert to break the barclays premier league record for assists .
on tuesday - his first international appearance since october - he was given just four out of 10 by one spanish newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the premier league title following a capital one cup win , questions remain about fabregas ' durability .
cesc fabregas ( right ) captained spain on tuesday but his poor form continued as they lost 2-0 in holland
the chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the european champions fell to defeat
after a brilliant start to the season at stamford bridge , the spaniard 's form has dropped off somewhat of late
` i 'm playing almost every minute of every match ( with chelsea ) and that 's what makes me happy , ' he said this week .
but a long , intense campaign on his return to england is taking its toll on the spaniard .
chelsea manager jose mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the amsterdam arena , adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the blues ' title charge decline of late .

jose mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the premier league run-in
diego costa and fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in chelsea 's 3-2 win at hull city
fabregas was brilliant for chelsea in their big win away at swansea city in january but has struggled since
after his £ 30million transfer to chelsea last summer , fabregas ' former club barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-christmas slump .
` there has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club , ' it read .
` despite glowing starts to each campaign , cesc 's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close .
` from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season . '
and it seems to have rung true on the stats front .
having picked up 15 premier league assists by mid-january , he has just one in five games he has played since , and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015 .
thierry henry 's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form , fabregas is now on track to fall just short .
however , with nine games to play chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against .
fabregas ' former team-mate thierry henry ( right ) holds the record for assists in a premier league season
henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump
when he left barcelona , the club commented on fabregas ' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump
their opponents on saturday , stoke city , as well as queens park rangers , manchester united , arsenal , leicester city and west bromwich albion have all been opened up by fabregas ' passing ability this season , while he scored in chelsea 's 2-0 win over crystal palace in october .
the personal accolade will be important to the midfielder , but more key is the boost it could give to his club .
chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games , and if fabregas finds form again the premier league title could be wrapped up within weeks .
mourinho will hope his assist for diego costa in chelsea 's last game against hull city is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong .
fabregas laid on an assist for costa in chelsea 's 3-17 win over hull city , but that was his first in five games
mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the premier league title race , with fabregas a key cog","The passage discusses the performance decline of Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas during the second half of the season. Despite an excellent start to the season, which saw him as a strong contender to break the Premier League record for assists, his form has significantly dropped. This trend was highlighted in Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland, where he was rated poorly by Spanish media.

Fabregas, who has expressed happiness with his playing time at Chelsea, has been visibly affected by the long and intense campaign. His recent performances for both club and country have been lackluster, with a notable decrease in his statistical contributions, particularly in assists. This pattern aligns with observations made by his former club Barcelona, who noted his tendency to start seasons strongly but fade as they progress.

Despite this slump, Fabregas has the opportunity to turn things around, as Chelsea faces several teams against which he has previously excelled. With nine games remaining in the season, his resurgence could be crucial in securing the Premier League title for Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, Chelsea's manager, is counting on Fabregas to regain his form and contribute to the team's success in the title race.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.62909,0.94012,0.90612,1,1.0

a former al qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting gadahn at peshawar airport in september 1998 .
gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .
cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda .
among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2038 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy .
gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child .
cnn 's steve almasy contributed to this report .","Adam Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, was a prominent member of al Qaeda and served as the group's chief English-language propagandist. Born in 1978 and raised on a farm in California, he converted to Islam at age 17 and moved to Pakistan at 21. Gadahn was indicted for treason and providing material support to al Qaeda by a federal grand jury in California in 2006. He appeared in numerous al Qaeda videos, threatening attacks on Western targets and urging Muslims to carry out lone-wolf attacks in the United States.

The White House announced in January that Gadahn was killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation, though he was not specifically targeted. Another American citizen and al Qaeda operative, Ahmed Farouq, was also killed in a separate operation, during which U.S. hostage Warren Weinstein and Italian hostage Giovanni Lo Porto died. Gadahn had a history of criticizing U.S. presidents and addressed his Jewish ancestry in his propaganda. He was among the FBI's most wanted terrorists and had called for the overthrow of governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Gadahn was married to an Afghan woman and had at least one child.

"she might be approaching her 89th birthday but nothing was going to stop the queen from enjoying a ride in the spring sunshine this morning .
the monarch , 88 , was spotted trotting through windsor great park aboard her faithful black fell pony , carltonlima emma .
joined by a groom on another of her fell ponies , the queen cut a relaxed figure as she enjoyed her ride but , as is her wont , eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves .
enjoying the sunshine : the queen enjoys a ride on her fell pony carltonlima emma
the queen , who has never worn riding helmets , has been encouraged to wear the safety hats in the past but is reportedly reluctant to wear one because of her hair .
speaking in an interview last year , her racing trainer ian balding recalled the moment he asked why the monarch never wears a riding hat .
the queen is said to have replied : ` i never have and you do n't have to have your hair done like i do . '
her majesty is famous for her love of horses and first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a shetland pony , named peggy , aged four .
since then , the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds , among them betsy , a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50 's , and surprise , a grey gelding whom the queen famously galloped down the course at ascot in 1961 .
equine enthusiast : her majesty adores the ponies and breeds them at hampton court
no helmet : the queen never wears a riding helmet , preferring instead to ride in a silk headscarf
cutting back : she has ridden less in recent years as a result of a niggling knee injury
long term love : the queen has ridden all her life and continues to breed several breeds of horse and pony
recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over trooping the colour on horseback .
nevertheless , the queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and , according to sources , is a familiar sight at her windsor stables .
she is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies , some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren , notably prince edward 's children , lady louise and james , viscount severn .
along with her thoroughbred race horses , the queen also breeds fell ponies and has a stud specialising in highland ponies at balmoral .
first love : the queen 's first pony was a tiny shetland named peggy who was given to her at the age of four
familiar sight : the queen riding her much-loved horse burmese during trooping the colour
seal of approval : a fell pony foal similar to those being bred by the queen at hampton court
one of the oldest equine breeds on the planet , fell ponies like the queen 's mount carltonlima emma , have roamed the moors of cumbria since the neolithic period .
docile , hardy and thick-set , the majority of fell ponies are black , grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh .
highly prized by the carvetii , the iron age tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago , the ponies later caught the eye of the invading romans and were used as trade goods all over the empire .
the romans also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today .
originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall ( similar to dartmoor and exmoor ponies ) , by the end of the roman period , the average fell was more than a hand higher .
another invader to fall in love with the fell pony was the vikings , who used the animals as pack ponies ; a use continued by the normans .
by the 13th century , the fell 's usefulness as a pack animal was well-established and the pony played an important role in british trade until the end of the 18th century .
following the industrial revolution , fells were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town , as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed .
although previously used in trotting races , the fell pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s , when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families .
today , the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages , among them the queen who breeds fell ponies at her hampton court stud .
source : the fell pony society","1. The Queen, approaching her 89th birthday, was seen enjoying a ride on her black fell pony, Carltonlima Emma, in Windsor Great Park.
2. Despite being 88 years old, the monarch appeared relaxed during her ride, choosing to wear a silk scarf instead of a helmet due to her reluctance to wear riding helmets, which has been encouraged in the past.
3. The Queen's love for horses began at age four with her first pony, Peggy, and she has since owned many horses, including Betsy and Surprise, and continues to breed various breeds.
4. In recent years, the Queen has reduced her riding due to a knee injury that also led her to stop riding during Trooping the Colour.
5. The Queen is known to take a keen interest in her horses and ponies, some of which are now ridden by her grandchildren.
6. She breeds fell ponies and has a stud for highland ponies at Balmoral, as well as a stud at Hampton Court.
7. Fell ponies, like the Queen's mount Carltonlima Emma, are one of the oldest equine breeds, originating from the moors of Cumbria in the Neolithic period.
8. These ponies are known for being docile, hardy, and thick-set, with most being black, grey, or bay and measuring between 13 and 14 hands high.
9. Historically, fell ponies were valued by the Carvetii tribe, the Romans, and the Vikings, and were used for various purposes including trade, packing, and as riding horses.
10. The breed's popularity increased in the 1950s for family riding due to their gentle nature and attractive appearance, and they remain a popular choice for riders today.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.70299,0.93274,0.97734,1,1.0

Despite the danger, Saeed exited his vehicle and approached the lion on foot, armed only with his camera. He managed to get within 10 feet of the lion and capture a few photographs before the sound of his camera's shutter drew the lion's attention. At that point, Saeed had to make a quick retreat to the safety of his car as the lion lunged aggressively towards him. Reflecting on the incident, Saeed described the lion's behavior as treating him like prey and acknowledged the extreme danger of the situation, realizing he might not take such a risk again.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.99111,0.97129,0.9934,1,1.0

3. The shared iPad students scored approximately 30 points higher than students who used iPads individually and those who did not use iPads at all.
4. Blackwell suggests that the collaborative learning facilitated by sharing iPads, rather than collaboration alone, is responsible for the improved literacy outcomes.
5. Blackwell recommends that schools reconsider how tablets are used, particularly in lower grades, to maximize their effectiveness in education.

2. The phenomenon was captured by photographer Andy Hutchinson, who described the glowing scene as ""beautiful"" and ""supernatural,"" caused by light-emitting plankton.
3. A similar event occurred at Sydney's Manly Beach in August 2014.
4. According to Iain Suthers from the University of New South Wales, the glow is produced by Noctiluca scintillans, a type of single-celled phytoplankton that is common in the sea.
5. Suthers further explains that these blooms typically happen in spring and autumn, with 90% of occurrences being naturally caused.
6. The glowing effect is a defense mechanism of Noctiluca scintillans, which is a carnivorous cell that preys on diatoms, another type of algae.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.94403,0.96955,0.98238,1,1.0
"breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic ` markers '
breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic ` markers ' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness .
after surgery , the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened , and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning .
for some women , the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent , which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy .
the majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence .
although the medication kills off cancer cells , the side effects -- including complete hair loss , nausea , sickness , weight gain or loss , and extreme fatigue -- can be difficult to live with .
for some women , the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself .
but experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others , and that for some , chemotherapy may not be necessary .
if the newest of the tests , called endopredict , shows a low score , patients can opt not to have chemotherapy .
most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £ 2,500 , although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the nhs .
surgeon hemant singhal said : ` i think there is a good case for the nhs to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy . '
professor kefah mokbel , consultant breast surgeon at st george 's hospital , london , said : ` with this test we can help patients make an informed choice , whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone . '
becca cornford , a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11 , six and four , was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast .
the majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence
she said : ` i dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy .
i was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children . '
professor mokbel operated on becca in december at the princess grace hospital , london , and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the endopredict .
a low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds .
` i could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return , ' she says .
` there is no treatment that places your chances at zero .
but if you have regular monitoring , there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early . '","A new genetic test, EndoPredict, can determine the aggressiveness of breast cancer tumors by identifying genetic markers. This test helps to assess the risk of cancer recurrence after surgery, potentially sparing some patients from chemotherapy. Women can learn within days if their risk of recurrence is low, possibly as low as five percent, which is comparable to or better than the odds after chemotherapy. Traditionally, most breast cancer patients undergo chemotherapy to prevent recurrence despite its harsh side effects, which include hair loss, nausea, and fatigue. However, experts believe that chemotherapy may not be necessary for all patients, as the risk of recurrence varies. The EndoPredict test can inform patients' decisions about whether to proceed with chemotherapy. Currently, these tests are primarily available privately for about £2,500, but there is hope that they will soon be incorporated into the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. Surgeon Hemant Singhal and Professor Kefah Mokbel support the use of this test in the NHS, arguing that the cost is justified by the potential savings from avoiding unnecessary chemotherapy. Rebecca Cornford, a patient who faced the prospect of chemotherapy after a second breast cancer diagnosis, opted out of chemotherapy after her tumor received a low EndoPredict score, indicating a 95% chance of remaining cancer-free for ten years without chemotherapy. She emphasizes the importance of regular monitoring and the potential to catch any recurrence early.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.8742,0.9587,0.89293,1,1.0

prime minister shinzo abe 's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many japanese , who view nuclear energy as too dangerous .
a staff member spotted the drone wednesday morning on the roof of abe 's residence , tokyo metropolitan police said .
dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone , which had four propeller and was 50 centimeters ( 20 inches ) wide .

cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed fukushima daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown .
investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle .
the amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans .

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 .
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said .
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets .
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

Hancock County, Tennessee, had the fewest heavy drinkers, while Esmeralda County, Nevada, recorded the most.

Excessive drinking is associated with significant public health issues, with about 88,600 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an estimated annual cost of over $220 billion. Public health experts suggest that cultural and economic factors, including changed social norms allowing women to drink similarly to men, the influence of affluent young professionals in cities like San Francisco and San Jose, and the decreased real cost of alcohol due to stable taxes, contribute to the increase in excessive drinking. Additionally, increased alcohol advertising and weakened alcohol control policies may also play a role.

the knightsbridge flat , london , which is on sale for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes , has just three years left on the lease .
the cost would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area .
the entrance to the flats in one of the most expensive areas to live in britain where a three-bedroom apartment has been put on the market for just £ 575,000
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the property could be worth upwards of £ 6 million .
the ` unmodernised ' maisonette in the in exclusive egerton place , is described as ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space .
it boasts three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a reception room and utility room along with a lift , parking and a communal garden .
the property is being sold by russell simpson for £ 575,000 - the same price as a three-bedroom house in stanmore , middlesex .
it is one of two maisonettes being sold with three years remaining on the lease .
both homes will need to be modernised , with the second , larger property - also on egerton place - on the market for £ 595,000 .
the next cheapest three-bedroom property in knightsbridge costs £ 1.5 million , and this flat is only offered with a 28-year lease .
but the property comes with a catch , not only is it in dire need of renovation , ( such as in one of its bedrooms , pictured ) the home has just three years left on the lease
the cost for £ 575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area , plus renovation works which are needed , such as in the living room ( pictured )
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space , could be worth upwards of £ 6 million
jake russell , from russell simpson , said : ` properties like this come up once in a blue moon and i think it is an outstanding opportunity .
` to get properties like this in egerton place is very exciting and the phone has n't stopped ringing , which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner .
` we have had interest from locals , developers and end users .
in modernised condition , we would estimate they would sell for between £ 2,750 and £ 3,000 per sq/ft . '
this gives the smaller property a £ 6 million prices tag , while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £ 7.5 million .
the current freeholder is thought to be the welcome trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and , for a 90-year lease , it is likely to cost between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million .
egerton place was built off michael 's grove by john grover and son to the designs of architect mervyn macartney around 1893 .
the properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the egerton gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets , finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange .
estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone ` has n't stopped ringing ' about the egerton place apartment
but alex newall , from hanover private office , had a warning to potential buyers : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease '
leases of all the homes were granted by the smith 's charity trustees in 1894 , and its first occupant was , sir evan macgregor , permanent secretary to the admiralty .
other residents of high status included the dowager lady lawrence , probably the widow of the first baron lawrence , at no. 5 , and sir henry fielding dickens , q.c. , son of the novelist charles at no. 2 .
one property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases .
alex newall , from hanover private office , said : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease .
` a developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder .
` it is a very quirky situation .
properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like knightsbridge .
` i know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought ` right , i need to extend it ' , but by then it was too late and the extension was too much .
` let it be a warning to check your lease . '","A three-bedroom apartment in London's upscale Knightsbridge area is listed for £575,000, significantly lower than neighboring properties. However, the flat comes with a short lease of only three years remaining. The annual cost of owning the property, considering the lease duration, is comparable to the local rental rates for similar-sized flats, at £191,000 per year or £15,000 per month. The apartment, described as ""bright and well proportioned,"" spans 1,990 square feet and includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, a utility room, a lift, parking, and a communal garden. It is one of two maisonettes for sale with the same lease condition, both needing modernization.

Despite its need for renovation and the short lease, the property presents an investment opportunity, as extending the lease could increase its value to around £6 million. The property's freeholder is the Welcome Trust, with whom any lease extension negotiations would take place, potentially costing between £3.35 and £4.5 million for a 90-year lease extension.

Built in 1893, Egerton Place is known for its high-quality architecture, and properties like these rarely come onto the market with such short leases. Interest has been high from locals, developers, and end-users, despite the upcoming election. Estate agents estimate that in modernized condition, the property could sell for £2,750 to £3,000 per square foot, which would price the smaller property at £6 million and the larger one at £7.5 million.

Prospective buyers are cautioned by property consultant Alex Newall about the significant cost of extending the lease, suggesting that a developer might be the most likely buyer or someone might use it as a rental for the remaining lease term. The history of Egerton Place includes notable residents such as Sir Evan Macgregor and Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, Q.C. The rarity of such properties coming onto the market with short leases underscores the importance of checking lease terms to avoid costly extensions later on.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.7012,0.95693,0.96675,1,1.0

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles .
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title .
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium .
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision .
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 .
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even .
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' .
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief .
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out .
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement .
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving .
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab .
voom , i 'd snap it back again .
he 'd try to get me on the ropes .
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . '
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated .
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face .
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside .
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . '
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned .
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible .
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in .
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight .
he quit because he was embarrassed . '
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action .
television commercials featuring him were taken off .
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem .
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title .
rejoicing returned to the streets .
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title .
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas .
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","1. The upcoming fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao is anticipated to be the most financially significant fight of all time and the most important of this century.

"( cnn ) thinking about presidential candidates ?
apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider .
according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?
as cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : "" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .
in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .
i do n't support a woman being president . ""
"" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , "" rios wrote in a facebook post .
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .
throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .
studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .
if science does n't convince you , just google "" cheating politicians "" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .
rios has taken a lot of flak for her "" biblically "" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .
time magazine declared hillary clinton the "" perfect "" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is "" biologically primed "" to lead .
( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )
believe me , i wish i were .
no wonder jon stewart left "" the daily show "" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .
we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .
and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .
unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .
some people believe women have "" our place "" and that place is not at the table .
they 'll tell your daughter to "" go for it "" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .
in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .
the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as "" geniuses "" and the women as "" nice . ""
the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .
hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .
that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .
the fact is , equality benefits everyone .
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .
it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .
it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .
and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .
our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .
it 's not enough to say to our daughters : "" you can be anything you want to be . ""
what we need to say is : "" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . ""

apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 1993 .
correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .","1. The passage discusses the impact of hormones on presidential candidates, particularly focusing on the gender bias against women in leadership roles.
2. Cheryl Rios, CEO of Go Ape Marketing, expressed the belief that women should not be president due to their hormones potentially leading to irrational decisions, such as starting an unnecessary war.
3. This view is contrasted with historical examples of male leaders whose decision-making was potentially impaired by their hormones, suggesting that male candidates might be more prone to risky behavior.
4. Studies indicate that women leaders tend to take fewer unnecessary risks compared to men.
5. The passage points out that despite progress in gender equality, women still face significant bias in the workplace and in leadership positions.
6. The article mentions Time Magazine's endorsement of Hillary Clinton as the ""perfect"" age to be president, citing her postmenopausal status as being ""biologically primed"" to lead, downplaying the hormonal argument.
7. The passage highlights the prevalent gender bias in society, noting that women are often undervalued and face both overt and covert discrimination in the workplace.
8. It emphasizes the need to address and eradicate gender stereotypes to benefit society economically, socially, and within families.
9. The article argues that equality is not just a women's issue but is beneficial for everyone, citing evidence that companies with more women in leadership roles perform better financially.
10. The passage concludes by refuting Rios' claim about women and leadership, noting Canada's election of Kim Campbell as the country's first female prime minister in 1993, and corrects an earlier statement regarding Campbell's election.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.75627,0.86771,0.86286,1,1.0

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .
the care assistant , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 50 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Leonie Granger, a 25-year-old care assistant and aspiring model from Gillingham, Kent, has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for the manslaughter of Mehmet Hassan, a 56-year-old professional gambler. Granger targeted Hassan after seeing him with a roll of £50 notes at a London casino. She used her looks to befriend him, gaining gifts, cash, and fancy dinners in return. Granger then set up Hassan by leaving his flat door unlocked, allowing her boyfriend, Kyrron Jackson, and his accomplice, Nicholas Chandler, to enter and brutally attack Hassan, ultimately leading to his death. They tied him up, beat him severely, and ransacked his home looking for his gambling winnings.

Granger was found guilty of manslaughter by a majority verdict, while Jackson and Chandler were convicted of murder and received life sentences with a minimum of 36 years. The judge described the attack as ""pitiless and wicked,"" highlighting Granger's deceitfulness and lack of compassion. Although Granger's defense claimed she was manipulated by her love for Jackson, the judge noted that she prioritized Jackson over any moral considerations.

The trial revealed that Hassan was unaware of the plot, generously showering Granger with money and attention. After their first date, Granger was overheard discussing Hassan's wealth. On the night of the murder, Hassan had taken Granger to a high-end restaurant and given her £1,000 to gamble with at the Palm Beach Casino. After returning to his flat, Granger let in Jackson and Chandler, who proceeded with the fatal robbery.

The killers were captured on Granger's phone celebrating with the stolen cash, and they were eventually apprehended after her phone records were analyzed. Hassan's body was found with signs of a violent struggle, and it was determined that he had been subjected to a ""vicious and sustained attack."" The prosecutor described Hassan as a ""soft target"" due to his habit of keeping large amounts of cash in his flat and his enjoyment of female companionship, which made him vulnerable.

Granger, Jackson, and Chandler were also found guilty of robbing Hassan and conspiring to falsely imprison him. Additionally, Jackson and Chandler were convicted of plotting armed robberies at a casino and conspiracy to falsely imprison casino employees. The jury was presented with CCTV footage of the robberies and clips of Granger and Hassan together, as well as footage of the defendants with the stolen money post-murder.

"it seems an accepted trend that chelsea midfielder cesc fabregas struggles during the second half of the season and the spanish midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country 's 2-0 defeat by holland on tuesday .

on tuesday - his first international appearance since october - he was given just four out of 10 by one spanish newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the premier league title following a capital one cup win , questions remain about fabregas ' durability .

after a brilliant start to the season at stamford bridge , the spaniard 's form has dropped off somewhat of late
` i 'm playing almost every minute of every match ( with chelsea ) and that 's what makes me happy , ' he said this week .
but a long , intense campaign on his return to england is taking its toll on the spaniard .
chelsea manager jose mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the amsterdam arena , adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the blues ' title charge decline of late .

diego costa and fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in chelsea 's 3-2 win at hull city
fabregas was brilliant for chelsea in their big win away at swansea city in january but has struggled since
after his £ 30million transfer to chelsea last summer , fabregas ' former club barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-christmas slump .
` there has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club , ' it read .
` despite glowing starts to each campaign , cesc 's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close .
` from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season . '
and it seems to have rung true on the stats front .
having picked up 15 premier league assists by mid-january , he has just one in five games he has played since , and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015 .
thierry henry 's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form , fabregas is now on track to fall just short .
however , with nine games to play chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against .

the personal accolade will be important to the midfielder , but more key is the boost it could give to his club .
chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games , and if fabregas finds form again the premier league title could be wrapped up within weeks .
mourinho will hope his assist for diego costa in chelsea 's last game against hull city is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong .
fabregas laid on an assist for costa in chelsea 's 3-2 win over hull city , but that was his first in five games
mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the premier league title race , with fabregas a key cog","The passage discusses Cesc Fabregas' performance decline in the second half of the season, a trend observed during his time at Barcelona and now at Chelsea. Despite a strong start to the season, which saw him on track to break the Premier League record for assists, his form has dipped significantly. This was evident in his recent subpar performance for Spain against Holland, where he was rated poorly by Spanish media.

Fabregas, who expressed happiness at playing regularly for Chelsea, has been feeling the effects of a long and intense season. His recent statistics reflect this slump; after amassing 15 Premier League assists by mid-January, he has only managed one assist in his last five games for Chelsea and none in his international appearance. This trend aligns with the comments made by his former club Barcelona, which noted his tendency to start seasons strongly but fade as they progress.

Despite this, Fabregas has the opportunity to turn things around, as Chelsea faces six teams he has previously provided assists against this season. With nine games left, his resurgence could be crucial in securing the Premier League title for Chelsea, and his recent assist for Diego Costa against Hull City may signal a return to form. Jose Mourinho, Chelsea's manager, is counting on Fabregas to regain his early-season impact and help clinch the title in the coming weeks.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.53817,0.92826,0.87205,1,1.0

last night the victim , mike lane , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ` pathetic ' .

he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .
the face of the thug who kicked mr lane was captured on video .
following the attack , wiltshire police issued the suspect 's photograph , although he has not been identified .
in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr lane said : ` i 've been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence .
it 's angered us because we gave them evidence .
i 'm beginning to lose my trust in the police . '
wiltshire police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country .
this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .
they were looking for trouble -- it was a hardcore element we 'd not seen before .
` they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face .
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth .
i was knocked out for a few minutes .
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar . '
mr lane , who has paid £ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ` i feel let down and think the police could have done more . '
karen fieldsend , 42 , who made the call to police , is furious that the case has been dropped .
` it 's disgraceful , ' she said .
` if you had people assaulted in a city centre , something would be done , but in the countryside people forget about it . '

the countryside alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice .
last night a spokesman for wiltshire police said : ` we have been unable to move the inquiry further forward .

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .
the care assistant , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Leonie Granger, a 25-year-old care assistant and aspiring model from Gillingham, Kent, has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for the manslaughter of Mehmet Hassan, a 56-year-old professional gambler. Granger targeted Hassan after seeing him with a roll of £50 notes at a London casino. She used her looks to befriend him, gaining gifts, cash, and fancy dinners in return. Granger then facilitated the robbery and murder of Hassan by leaving his flat door unlocked, allowing her boyfriend, Kyrron Jackson, and his accomplice, Nicholas Chandler, to enter and brutally attack Hassan, ultimately leading to his death.

The attack was described as ""pitiless and wicked"" by Judge William Kennedy, who sentenced Granger. Although Granger was found not guilty of murder, she was convicted of manslaughter by a majority of 10 to 2. Her co-defendants, Jackson and Chandler, were convicted of murder and received life sentences with a minimum term of 36 years. They were also found guilty of additional charges related to armed robbery and conspiracy to falsely imprison casino employees.

The trial revealed that Hassan was unaware of the plot as he spent time with Granger, whom he knew as ""Rachel."" After their first date, Granger was overheard discussing Hassan's wealth. On the night of the murder, Hassan took Granger to a high-end restaurant and gave her £1,000 to gamble with at the Palm Beach Casino. Later, at his flat, Granger let in Jackson and Chandler, who tied up Hassan, assaulted him, and ransacked his home for cash. They fled with £3,000, a TV, and a mobile phone but were apprehended after Granger's phone records were analyzed.

Hassan's family expressed their ongoing grief over his death.

"it seems an accepted trend that chelsea midfielder cesc fabregas struggles during the second half of the season and the spanish midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country 's 2-0 defeat by holland on tuesday .
the 27-year-old spoke of his happiness in south west london earlier this week but his form has significantly dipped from that of the player who , around christmas , looked a dead-cert to break the barclays premier league record for assists .
on tuesday - his first international appearance since october - he was given just four out of 10 by one spanish newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the premier league title following a capital one cup win , questions remain about fabregas ' durability .
cesc fabregas ( right ) captained spain on tuesday but his poor form continued as they lost 2-0 in holland
the chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the european champions fell to defeat
after a brilliant start to the season at stamford bridge , the spaniard 's form has dropped off somewhat of late
` i 'm playing almost every minute of every match ( with chelsea ) and that 's what makes me happy , ' he said this week .
but a long , intense campaign on his return to england is taking its toll on the spaniard .
chelsea manager jose mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the amsterdam arena , adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the blues ' title charge decline of late .
fabregas captained the european champions in the dutch capital but struggled to make any real impact against manchester united 's daley blind or goalscorer davy klaassen .
jose mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the premier league run-in
diego costa and fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in chelsea 's 3-2 win at hull city
fabregas was brilliant for chelsea in their big win away at swansea city in january but has struggled since
after his £ 30million transfer to chelsea last summer , fabregas ' former club barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-christmas slump .
` there has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club , ' it read .
` despite glowing starts to each campaign , cesc 's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close .
` from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season . '
and it seems to have rung true on the stats front .
having picked up 15 premier league assists by mid-january , he has just one in five games he has played since , and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015 .
thierry henry 's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form , fabregas is now on track to fall just short .
however , with nine games to play chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against .
fabregas ' former team-mate thierry henry ( right ) holds the record for assists in a premier league season
henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump
when he left barcelona , the club commented on fabregas ' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump
their opponents on saturday , stoke city , as well as queens park rangers , manchester united , arsenal , leicester city and west bromwich albion have all been opened up by fabregas ' passing ability this season , while he scored in chelsea 's 2-0 win over crystal palace in october .
the personal accolade will be important to the midfielder , but more key is the boost it could give to his club .
chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games , and if fabregas finds form again the premier league title could be wrapped up within weeks .
mourinho will hope his assist for diego costa in chelsea 's last game against hull city is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong .
fabregas laid on an assist for costa in chelsea 's 3-6 win over hull city , but that was his first in five games
mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the premier league title race , with fabregas a key cog","The passage discusses Cesc Fabregas' performance decline in the second half of the season, a trend observed during his time at Barcelona and now at Chelsea. Despite a strong start to the season, which saw him on track to break the Premier League record for assists, his form has dipped significantly. This was evident in his recent subpar performance for Spain against Holland, where he was rated poorly by Spanish media.

Fabregas, who expressed happiness at playing regularly for Chelsea, has been feeling the effects of a long and intense season. His recent statistics reflect this slump; after amassing 15 Premier League assists by mid-January, he has only managed one assist in his last five games for Chelsea and none in his international appearance. This trend aligns with the comments made by his former club Barcelona, which noted his tendency to start seasons strongly but fade as they progress.

Despite this, Fabregas has the opportunity to turn things around, as Chelsea faces six teams he has previously provided assists against this season. With nine games left, his resurgence could be crucial in securing the Premier League title for Chelsea, and his recent assist for Diego Costa against Hull City may signal a return to form. Jose Mourinho, Chelsea's manager, is counting on Fabregas to regain his early-season impact and help clinch the title in the coming weeks.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.53195,0.92975,0.87493,1,1.0
"police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place -- despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker .
last night the victim , mike lane , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ` pathetic ' .
he said : ` they could have made more effort .
i 've been told that unless further evidence comes forward , the attackers are not likely to be found .

attack : mike lane ,40 , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs
a video of the incident and a dossier of evidence , including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers , was given to wiltshire police after the assault .
the attack at everleigh , near amesbury , took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent , rather than a fox .
during the incident , mr lane , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , was sent flying to the ground , before being kicked in the head .
he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .
the face of the thug who kicked mr lane was captured on video .
following the attack , wiltshire police issued the suspect 's photograph , although he has not been identified .
in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr lane said : ` i 've been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence .
it 's angered us because we gave them evidence .
i 'm beginning to lose my trust in the police . '
wiltshire police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country .
this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .
they were looking for trouble -- it was a hardcore element we 'd not seen before .
` they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face .
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth .
i was knocked out for a few minutes .
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar . '
mr lane , who has paid £ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ` i feel let down and think the police could have done more . '
karen fieldsend , 42 , who made the call to police , is furious that the case has been dropped .
` it 's disgraceful , ' she said .
` if you had people assaulted in a city centre , something would be done , but in the countryside people forget about it . '
james cameron , 55 , vice-chairman of the tedworth hunt , added : ` their decision is disappointing , but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings . '
the countryside alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice .
last night a spokesman for wiltshire police said : ` we have been unable to move the inquiry further forward .
at this stage the case has been recorded as undetected , however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened .

the group also wanted incest to be legalised .
o'carroll was on the nccl 's gay rights sub-committee .

This comes after last week's severe weather, which included three days of heavy rain and strong winds, caused significant destruction, especially in the Hunter region. The State Emergency Service (SES) has been inundated with over 24,000 requests for assistance and still has more than 4,000 jobs to complete. SES spokeswoman Stephanie Wills expressed concern that further storms could hamper ongoing clean-up efforts and exacerbate the situation in areas where the ground is already saturated.

Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott reported that a trough of low pressure is forming along the coast, with the heaviest impact expected in the far northern parts of NSW. Although the system appears to be moving quickly and may not affect Sydney as heavily as the previous storm, the Bureau of Meteorology's NSW regional director, Barry Hanstrum, warned that intense rainfall and strong winds are likely to impact coastal areas in the state's northeast, including the Northern Rivers and Mid North Coast, as well as southeast Queensland. The bureau indicated that rainfall is expected to increase throughout the week and peak between Thursday and Saturday, potentially causing further flooding in already affected catchments.

The SES, with over 1000 personnel in the field, including interstate support, is focusing on completing as many outstanding jobs as possible before the next weather system arrives. They are also urging communities to prepare their homes and families for the possibility of another severe storm.

meanwhile only five per cent of those surveyed said that had ever asked their children to wash the car , as a way for them to earn extra pocket money .
factors behind the decline vary from shops now opening on a sunday and more live football on tv , meaning more people put off the chore at the weekend .
the rise of hand car washes has been blamed for a decrease in drivers washing their own cars ( file pic )
other reasons given for not washing cars include the rise of hand car washes and the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean .
brits are more likely to wash their own car during the holidays as the recent easter break saw an estimated 15 million cars cleaned by their owners .

` but let 's face it , we do n't have as much time any more , the cars are bigger and even the kids do n't seem to want to earn a bit of extra money doing it for us either .
` on top of that , there is now plenty of choice out there if you want to put the car through an automated machine or get a gang of enthusiastic guys to do it for you fairly cheaply . '","The passage indicates that the tradition of washing one's own car on Sundays in Britain is declining. A study by the vehicle leasing firm OSV of 1,100 adults found that a third of men (31%) have never washed their own car, with only 12% of those who do saying they do it regularly. The situation is more pronounced among women, with three-quarters never washing their own car. Instead, drivers are increasingly using car washes on local forecourts.

The reasons for this shift include the opening of shops on Sundays, more live football on TV, and the rise of hand car washes. Additionally, the size of modern 4x4 and off-road vehicles makes them difficult for owners to clean. However, during holidays like Easter, an estimated 15 million cars are washed by their owners, with one in four people doing it as an excuse to leave the house.

Geographically, cars are most frequently washed by their owners in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield, and least often in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. The types of cars washed most often by their owners are Audis, Toyotas, and BMWs, while Range Rovers, Peugeots, and Mercedes are washed the least.

Andrew Kirkley of OSV notes that the decline in personal car washing is due to a combination of factors, including time constraints, larger vehicles, and a lack of interest from children in earning money by washing cars. He also points out the availability of automated car washes and affordable hand car wash services as contributing factors.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.61018,0.95784,0.97412,1,1.0

"( cnn ) thinking about presidential candidates ?
apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider .
according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?
as cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : "" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .
in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .
i do n't support a woman being president . ""
"" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , "" rios wrote in a facebook post .
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .
throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .
studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .
if science does n't convince you , just google "" cheating politicians "" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .
rios has taken a lot of flak for her "" biblically "" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .
time magazine declared hillary clinton the "" perfect "" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is "" biologically primed "" to lead .
( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )
believe me , i wish i were .
no wonder jon stewart left "" the daily show "" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .
we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .
and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .
unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .
some people believe women have "" our place "" and that place is not at the table .
they 'll tell your daughter to "" go for it "" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .
in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .
the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as "" geniuses "" and the women as "" nice . ""
the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .
hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .
that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .
the fact is , equality benefits everyone .
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .
it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .
it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .
and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .
our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .
it 's not enough to say to our daughters : "" you can be anything you want to be . ""
what we need to say is : "" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . ""
rios said that if clinton is elected , she is "" moving to canada "" because "" a female should n't be president . ""
apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 2001 .
correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .","1. The passage discusses the impact of hormones on presidential candidates, particularly focusing on the gender bias against women in leadership roles.

"an aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his ` pitiless and wicked ' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years .
leonie granger , 25 , targeted playboy mehmet hassan , 56 , after spotting him flashing a roll of £ 50 notes at a casino in london 's west end .
the care assistant , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 58 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him . '","Leonie Granger, a 25-year-old care assistant and aspiring model from Gillingham, Kent, has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for the manslaughter of Mehmet Hassan, a 56-year-old professional gambler. Granger targeted Hassan after seeing him with a roll of £50 notes at a London casino. She used her looks to befriend him, gaining gifts, cash, and fancy dinners in return. Granger then facilitated the robbery and murder of Hassan by leaving his flat door unlocked, allowing her boyfriend, Kyrron Jackson, and his accomplice, Nicholas Chandler, to enter and brutally attack Hassan, ultimately leading to his death.

The attack was described as ""pitiless and wicked"" by Judge William Kennedy, who sentenced Granger. Although Granger was found not guilty of murder, she was convicted of manslaughter by a majority of 10 to 2. Her co-defendants, Jackson and Chandler, were convicted of murder and received life sentences with a minimum term of 36 years. They were also found guilty of additional charges related to armed robbery and conspiracy to falsely imprison casino employees.

The trial revealed that Hassan was unaware of the plot as he spent time with Granger, whom he knew as ""Rachel."" After their first date, Granger was overheard discussing Hassan's wealth. On the night of the murder, Hassan took Granger to a high-end restaurant and gave her £1,000 to gamble with at the Palm Beach Casino. Later, at his flat, Granger let in Jackson and Chandler, who tied up Hassan, assaulted him, and ransacked his home for cash. They fled with £3,000, a TV, and a mobile phone but were apprehended after Granger's phone records were analyzed.

Hassan's family expressed their ongoing grief over his death. The prosecutor highlighted the victim's habit of keeping large amounts of cash in his flat and his vulnerability due to his lifestyle, which made him a target for the greed-driven attack by Granger, Jackson, and Chandler.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.52466,0.94645,0.96628,1,1.0
"it seems an accepted trend that chelsea midfielder cesc fabregas struggles during the second half of the season and the spanish midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country 's 2-0 defeat by holland on tuesday .
the 27-year-old spoke of his happiness in south west london earlier this week but his form has significantly dipped from that of the player who , around christmas , looked a dead-cert to break the barclays premier league record for assists .
on tuesday - his first international appearance since october - he was given just four out of 10 by one spanish newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the premier league title following a capital one cup win , questions remain about fabregas ' durability .
cesc fabregas ( right ) captained spain on tuesday but his poor form continued as they lost 2-0 in holland
the chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the european champions fell to defeat
after a brilliant start to the season at stamford bridge , the spaniard 's form has dropped off somewhat of late
` i 'm playing almost every minute of every match ( with chelsea ) and that 's what makes me happy , ' he said this week .
but a long , intense campaign on his return to england is taking its toll on the spaniard .
chelsea manager jose mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the amsterdam arena , adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the blues ' title charge decline of late .

jose mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the premier league run-in
diego costa and fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in chelsea 's 3-2 win at hull city
fabregas was brilliant for chelsea in their big win away at swansea city in january but has struggled since
after his £ 30million transfer to chelsea last summer , fabregas ' former club barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-christmas slump .
` there has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club , ' it read .
` despite glowing starts to each campaign , cesc 's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close .
` from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season . '
and it seems to have rung true on the stats front .
having picked up 15 premier league assists by mid-january , he has just one in five games he has played since , and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015 .
thierry henry 's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form , fabregas is now on track to fall just short .
however , with nine games to play chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against .
fabregas ' former team-mate thierry henry ( right ) holds the record for assists in a premier league season
henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump
when he left barcelona , the club commented on fabregas ' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump
their opponents on saturday , stoke city , as well as queens park rangers , manchester united , arsenal , leicester city and west bromwich albion have all been opened up by fabregas ' passing ability this season , while he scored in chelsea 's 2-0 win over crystal palace in october .
the personal accolade will be important to the midfielder , but more key is the boost it could give to his club .
chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games , and if fabregas finds form again the premier league title could be wrapped up within weeks .
mourinho will hope his assist for diego costa in chelsea 's last game against hull city is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong .
fabregas laid on an assist for costa in chelsea 's 3-13 win over hull city , but that was his first in five games
mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the premier league title race , with fabregas a key cog","The passage discusses the performance decline of Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas during the second half of the season. Despite an excellent start to the season, which saw him as a strong contender to break the Premier League record for assists, his form has significantly dropped. This trend was highlighted in Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland, where he was rated poorly by Spanish media.

Fabregas, who expressed happiness at playing regularly for Chelsea, has been visibly affected by the long and intense campaign. His recent performances for both club and country have been lackluster, with only one Premier League assist in his last five games, compared to 15 by mid-January.

His former club, Barcelona, had previously noted his tendency to experience a slump in form post-Christmas, with his contributions diminishing as seasons progressed. Despite this, Fabregas has the opportunity to regain his form against several teams he has previously excelled against in the current season, which could be crucial for Chelsea's title aspirations.

Jose Mourinho, Chelsea's manager, is counting on Fabregas to rediscover his early-season prowess to secure the Premier League title. The midfielder's ability to create chances could be pivotal in the remaining games, and his recent assist for Diego Costa against Hull City may indicate a resurgence in form.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.51692,0.93573,0.83803,1,1.0

he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .

this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .
they were looking for trouble -- it was a hardcore element we 'd not seen before .
` they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face .
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth .
i was knocked out for a few minutes .
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar . '
mr lane , who has paid £ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ` i feel let down and think the police could have done more . '
karen fieldsend , 42 , who made the call to police , is furious that the case has been dropped .
` it 's disgraceful , ' she said .
` if you had people assaulted in a city centre , something would be done , but in the countryside people forget about it . '
james cameron , 58 , vice-chairman of the tedworth hunt , added : ` their decision is disappointing , but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings . '
the countryside alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice .

the white house announced thursday that adam gadahn , 36 , was killed in january in a u.s. government counterterrorism operation .
neither he nor ahmed farouq -- another u.s. citizen and al qaeda operative who died in what the white house said was "" likely a separate "" operation -- was specifically targeted , according to the statement .
warren weinstein , a u.s. citizen who was abducted by al qaeda in pakistan in 2011 , died along with another hostage , italian giovanni lo porto , in the attack that killed farouq , according to the white house .
white house : u.s. hostage killed in strike on al qaeda
while he was n't one of al qaeda 's top leaders , gadahn was one of its most prominent members , given his many statements on behalf of the organization .
also known as azzam the american , he was born in 1978 .
his parents changed their name from pearlman to gadahn after their marriage .
he grew up on a farm in rural california and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents , who were jewish .
he converted to islam in 1995 and left the united states for pakistan three years later .
his father said gadahn last contacted the family in 2002 .
a former al qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting gadahn at peshawar airport in september 1998 .
gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .
cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda .
among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2021 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy .
gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child .

"( cnn ) thinking about presidential candidates ?
apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider .
according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?
as cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : "" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .
in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .
i do n't support a woman being president . ""
"" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , "" rios wrote in a facebook post .
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .
throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .
studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .
if science does n't convince you , just google "" cheating politicians "" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .
rios has taken a lot of flak for her "" biblically "" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .
time magazine declared hillary clinton the "" perfect "" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is "" biologically primed "" to lead .
( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )
believe me , i wish i were .
no wonder jon stewart left "" the daily show "" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .
we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .
and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .
unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .
some people believe women have "" our place "" and that place is not at the table .
they 'll tell your daughter to "" go for it "" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .
in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .
the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as "" geniuses "" and the women as "" nice . ""
the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .
hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .
that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .
the fact is , equality benefits everyone .
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .
it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .
it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .
and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .
our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .
it 's not enough to say to our daughters : "" you can be anything you want to be . ""
what we need to say is : "" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . ""
rios said that if clinton is elected , she is "" moving to canada "" because "" a female should n't be president . ""
apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 2004 .
correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .","1. The passage discusses the impact of hormones on presidential candidates, particularly focusing on the gender bias against women in leadership roles.
2. Cheryl Rios, CEO of Go Ape Marketing, expressed the belief that women should not be president due to their hormones potentially leading to irrational decisions, such as starting an unnecessary war.
3. This view is contrasted with the historical perspective that male hormones have sometimes negatively affected male leaders' decision-making.
4. Studies indicate that women leaders tend to take fewer unnecessary risks compared to men.
5. The passage points out the double standard in the discussion of hormones, noting that male politicians have been involved in scandals due to hormonal influences.
6. Despite progress in gender equality, the passage highlights that women, including Hillary Clinton, still face significant bias in their quest for leadership positions, such as the presidency.
7. The article suggests that gender bias is deeply ingrained, affecting women's opportunities in the workplace and leadership roles.
8. It cites evidence of overt and covert bias, such as the underrepresentation of women on corporate boards and gender-based descriptions of professors.
9. The passage argues that diversity, including gender equality, benefits society economically, in family dynamics, and in corporate performance.
10. The article concludes by emphasizing the need to actively combat gender bias and support women in leadership, countering the incorrect belief that women are less suited for such roles, as demonstrated by the existence of female leaders in countries like Canada.
11. A correction is made at the end, noting an error in the initial statement about Canada's first female prime minister.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.72934,0.82431,0.89378,1,1.0
"( cnn ) he was known as the american mouthpiece of al qaeda , speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that 's devoted blood and resources to attacking it .
the white house announced thursday that adam gadahn , 36 , was killed in january in a u.s. government counterterrorism operation .
neither he nor ahmed farouq -- another u.s. citizen and al qaeda operative who died in what the white house said was "" likely a separate "" operation -- was specifically targeted , according to the statement .
warren weinstein , a u.s. citizen who was abducted by al qaeda in pakistan in 2011 , died along with another hostage , italian giovanni lo porto , in the attack that killed farouq , according to the white house .
white house : u.s. hostage killed in strike on al qaeda
while he was n't one of al qaeda 's top leaders , gadahn was one of its most prominent members , given his many statements on behalf of the organization .
also known as azzam the american , he was born in 1978 .
his parents changed their name from pearlman to gadahn after their marriage .
he grew up on a farm in rural california and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents , who were jewish .
he converted to islam in 1995 and left the united states for pakistan three years later .
his father said gadahn last contacted the family in 2002 .
a former al qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting gadahn at peshawar airport in september 1998 .
gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .
cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda .
among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2027 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy .
gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child .
cnn 's steve almasy contributed to this report .","Adam Gadahn, an American citizen also known as Azzam the American, was a prominent member of al Qaeda and served as the group's chief English-language spokesperson. Born in 1978 and raised on a farm in California, Gadahn converted to Islam at age 17 and moved to Pakistan at age 20. He was indicted for treason and providing material support to al Qaeda by a federal grand jury in California in 2006.

The White House announced in January that Gadahn was killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation, though he was not the specific target. Another American, Ahmed Farouq, also an al Qaeda operative, was killed in what was likely a separate operation. The same operation that killed Farouq also resulted in the deaths of two hostages: U.S. citizen Warren Weinstein and Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, who had been abducted by al Qaeda.

Gadahn rose to prominence within al Qaeda after 9/11, appearing in videos where he sometimes disguised himself and spoke in English or Arabic, threatening attacks and urging Muslims to target Western and Jewish interests. He criticized U.S. presidents and addressed his Jewish ancestry, going so far as to tear up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn encouraged lone-wolf attacks in the U.S. and praised acts of violence against Americans, including the Fort Hood shootings and the killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi.

He was married to an Afghan woman and had at least one child. Gadahn's involvement in al Qaeda included institutional roles, with documents found in Osama bin Laden's compound revealing his input on the group's media strategy. His last video, released in September 2014, called for the overthrow of the Saudi Arabian and Pakistani governments.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.54461,0.37785,0.18247,1,1.0

Indiana has experienced a significant increase in HIV cases, with 120 confirmed and 10 preliminary positive cases in Scott County, which is about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. This is an increase from 106 cases the previous week.
2. The outbreak, primarily among intravenous drug users, is linked to the use of the prescription painkiller Opana. Scott County typically sees about five HIV cases each year.
3. Governor Mike Pence approved a 30-day needle exchange program on March 26 in response to the epidemic declared by health officials last month. Since its implementation, over 5,300 clean syringes have been distributed to 86 participants, and about 1,400 used syringes have been returned.
4. The program's future is uncertain as Pence reviews reports and recommendations to decide whether to extend it beyond April 25. Pence generally opposes needle exchanges, fearing they may promote drug use.
5. Legislation to allow needle-exchange programs in other high-risk counties is being considered, with a bill scheduled for a hearing in a house-senate conference committee. The House has already approved the bill, but the Senate's support is uncertain.
6. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report a high correlation between HIV and hepatitis C infections, with 50% to 90% of hepatitis C patients also infected with HIV. High rates of hepatitis C are seen as an indicator of potential HIV outbreaks due to needle-sharing.
7. The temporary needle exchange program in Scott County was enacted through an emergency executive order by Governor Pence, but it does not include funding, raising concerns about its sustainability.
8. State agencies have been directed to find their own funding for the program, and there is skepticism about the Pence administration's long-term planning for addressing the issue.
9. Advocates for the needle exchange program, such as public health nurse Brittany Combs and House public health committee chairman Ed Clere, emphasize the importance of trust-building and view the program as a necessary harm-reduction strategy rather than an anti-drug policy.

During his sentencing hearing on Wednesday, Dellinger claimed he was not suicidal at the time of the incident, contradicting earlier statements to investigators that he had intended to kill himself. Dellinger's pickup truck crossed a median at high speed and collided with the couple's SUV, causing their immediate death along with their unborn child, who they planned to name Reagan Elizabeth.

Dellinger pleaded guilty to negligent homicide and one count of assault for the fetus's death, facing 12 to 24 years in prison. His defense argued that he was suffering from Ambien withdrawal, the effects of an overdose of a psychiatric drug, Prozac, and advanced symptoms of multiple sclerosis at the time of the crash. Despite holding high-level positions at various companies, including PPG Industries Inc., Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp., and General Electric Co., Dellinger's life took a turn, leading to the tragic event.

Dellinger's wife, Deborah, described him as a man of ethics and integrity, expressing their devastation over the victims' deaths and offering prayers for the families' peace. The defense also highlighted Dellinger's productive and exemplary life, noting his significant severance package and the substantial real estate assets owned by the Dellinger family trust. The prosecution, however, presented a different picture, stating that Dellinger had been driving around in a depressed and disoriented state after an argument with his wife about his medications, ultimately leading to the fatal decision to drive into the median.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.77938,0.9514,0.97415,1,1.0

"fears for two new strains of influenza , which caused a spike in deaths in europe and the united states , will see the arrival of an improved vaccination on australian shores . stocks of the influenza vaccine are arriving a month later than expected as scientists have included protection against influenza a strain h3n2 and influenza b strain b/phuket . the decision to include both was triggered by a spike in flu-related deaths in the northern hemisphere as the vaccine was not a good match to fight against the two types of flu . stocks of the influenza vaccine are arriving a month later than expected as scientists have included protection against two new strains . high-risk groups - such as the very young and very old , and most indigenous australians - will be able to access free , government-funded flu shots from april 20 . experts say the modified version of the vaccination is worth waiting for . but dr alan hampson , who chairs the influenza specialist group , said everyone should be getting the vaccine , which also provided protection against influenza a strain h1n1 . he said h3n2 and b/phuket caused a spike in deaths in europe and the us during the northern winter because the vaccine available did not provide the right buffer against the diseases . there was a spike in deaths related to h3n2 and b/phuket in europe and the us during the northern winter as the vaccine did not cover the strains . world health authorities realised that and modified the vaccine to be used in australia this winter . ' our vaccine now should be a really good match for the strains that are circulating globally and we certainly hope we can prevent more deaths per capita than they did , ' dr hampson told aap . ' in fact the vaccine that will be used in the next northern winter will be exactly the same as the one we 'll be using over the next few weeks . ' dr hampson said people should be booking their flu shots now , given the delay in stocks arriving . ' even if people are not in one of the high-risk groups , they are probably coming into contact with people in their own families who are , ' he said . ' those high-risk groups are harder to protect so it 's great if we can also protect the people around them . ' ","A new, improved influenza vaccine is being introduced in Australia to combat two new strains of the flu virus: influenza A strain H3N2 and influenza B strain B/Phuket. The vaccine's release has been delayed by a month due to the inclusion of protection against these strains, which were responsible for an increase in flu-related deaths in Europe and the United States during the northern winter. The existing vaccine did not effectively protect against these strains. The updated vaccine will be available for free to high-risk groups, including the very young, the very old, and most indigenous Australians, starting April 20. Dr. Alan Hampson, from the Influenza Specialist Group, emphasizes that everyone should get vaccinated, as the new vaccine also protects against influenza A strain H1N1. He notes that the vaccine has been modified to match the globally circulating strains and hopes it will prevent more deaths. Dr. Hampson advises people to book their flu shots in advance due to the delay in vaccine availability and encourages vaccination for all, especially those in contact with high-risk individuals, to create a protective barrier around them. The vaccine to be used in the upcoming southern winter in Australia will also be used in the next northern winter.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.82201,0.86588,0.72486,1,1.0

The tomb, which commemorates the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's assassination, has been described in National Geographic as lacking historical character and being akin to an office lobby. This critique comes at a time when Illinois is experiencing a financial crisis, and Governor Bruce Rauner has proposed dissolving the state historic preservation agency that manages the tomb, merging it into another department.

Despite recent renovations totaling over $2.5 million, which have left the tomb in excellent physical condition with upgraded lighting and ongoing work on waterproofing and landscaping, the site is under threat due to budget cuts. These cuts have already resulted in reduced hours and fewer staff members. The tomb, designed by Larkin Mead and dedicated by President Ulysses S. Grant, has undergone several reconstructions and features a circular structure with an obelisk, interior marble, and bronze trim.

Caretakers and supporters of the tomb argue that the National Geographic portrayal is unfair and do not reflect the majority's view. They express concern over the potential impact of further budget cuts on the management and presentation of the historic site. The tomb remains a popular tourist destination, with visitors like William Sparks expressing admiration for its beauty and significance, despite some not being able to access the interior due to unexpected closures.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.90295,0.90704,0.66048,1,1.0

'' she invited the discussion to the second floor , also known by the shorthand t2f . she said she knew it was a potentially dangerous move , and she had received death threats in the past when she handled the topic before . `` she was the bravest woman in the world , she really was , she was a brave heart ; my god , she was a brave , brave girl , '' zafar said . even in its secluded , humble location , t2f was a magnet to those seeking secular wisdom . they found it in a homey setting , musingly decorated like a small town college bookstore . the walls outside its entrance are sprayed with socially critical graffiti -- dusky red hearts float across gray walls . mahmud waited to greet visitors , many of them young pakistanis seeking freedom of thought , with a hug , a mug and encouragement for pakistan 's future . `` she hoped the same thing we all hoped for , a place that is fair with liberty and justice for all , '' zafar said . grief over her death and gratefulness for her work poured out on social media and via email . `` thanks for giving us the room to breathe when fog pressed heavy on our shoulders . it 's only been a few hours , sabeen , and the city is already gasping for air , '' a group of illustrators called from karachi with love wrote . an artist drew mahmud puttering off on a vespa scooter wearing pants , a blouse and sandals . her tightly coiffed short hair and angular glasses framed her bright-eyed features . missing was a head scarf . on a wall in t2f is a spray painted technicolor image of marilyn monroe from `` the seven year itch , '' her white dress replaced by a traditional outfit of mustard , ocher and green . but it still flew up over her hips , revealing her alabaster legs , a daringly sexy and satirical image . the artistic expression sticks out and triggers passions , like many things mahmud said and did .","Sabeen Mahmud was a prominent figure in Pakistan, known for her vibrant café in Islamabad that served as a hub for discussions on technology, human rights, and women's entrepreneurship. She was a vocal advocate for free speech in a country where such expression can be dangerous. Tragically, Mahmud was shot dead by two gunmen after closing her café in Karachi, and her mother was also injured in the attack.

Mahmud's death was deeply mourned by those who shared her commitment to non-violence and progressive values. She was seen as a beacon of humanism, love, and tolerance in Pakistan. Her café, known as the second floor or t2f, was a sanctuary for secular thought and was decorated to reflect a space of intellectual freedom and creativity.

Her killing occurred shortly after she hosted a discussion on the sensitive topic of the situation in Baluchistan, where there have been allegations of mass abductions and a violent insurgency. The event was initially canceled by the Lahore University of Management Sciences due to its controversial nature, but Mahmud insisted on holding it at her café despite knowing the risks, including previous death threats.

Mahmud's close friend and BBC journalist Ziad Zafar described her as exceptionally brave and a symbol of hope for a fair and free Pakistan. Her café was known for its socially critical graffiti and its role as a haven for those seeking liberty and justice. Her death sparked an outpouring of grief and gratitude for her contributions to Pakistani society, with many expressing the loss of a vital space for open dialogue and the fear that her absence would leave the city gasping for air. Artistic tributes celebrated her as a symbol of freedom and cultural expression, with images depicting her in a progressive and bold light, embodying the spirit of liberty she championed throughout her life.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.41772,0.81809,0.97189,0,1.0
"as healer mangu ram rests with a threadbare blanket over his creaking knees , the 82-year-old looks to the future . it is almost 70 years since he fled the violence that followed the partition of india , and he is still regarded as a second class citizen in indian kashmir – unable to own property or vote in state elections . but now ram and thousands like him are daring to hope they will finally be able to shed the refugee status that has plagued them for decades , after prime minister narendra modi 's hindu nationalist party won a share of power in india 's only muslim-majority state . mangu ram was 14 when he fled to kashmir as a refugee - now an old man , for the past 70 years he has been denied citizenship rights . a hindu , traditional healer ram lives a slum house within india 's only muslim-majority state . its rulers have refused to give the west pakistan refugees ( wprs ) the right to own property or vote in state elections -

despite most of them never visiting pakistan , and living in the jammu region of india . most of those refugees were quickly absorbed in towns and cities of the newly-independent nations . however the fate of the west pakistan refugees ( wprs ) like ram who decamped to jammu and kashmir state became mired in the dispute with pakistan over the territory . because of this , its rulers held off granting the refugees residential rights , including the right to buy land , vote in state polls or work in the state government.. . observers say the reluctance of successive state governments to grant full rights to the overwhelmingly hindu wprs stems from fears of upsetting the demographic balance in india 's only muslim-majority state , which has special autonomy enshrined in the constitution . a hindu refugee washes pots at a communal hand pump in surej chak , on the outskirts of jammu . the area has evolved into one of the many slum settlements in hind-dominated areas of the city region of jammu , within india 's only muslim-majority state . generations of families have become stuck in poverty because of their continuing refugee status . successive governments have failed to act to due , say commentators , to a fear of upsetting the demographic balance of the state between the muslim and hindu populations . the wprs , whose families mainly originate from punjab , have fallen foul of a pre-independence law that only grants citizenship to people born - or descendants of those born - in the old undivided kingdom of kashmir . the same legislation has allowed around 35,000 hindus who have fled pakistan-controlled kashmir since partition to be granted citizenship . there are around 100,000 people classified as wprs , most living in the jammu region . hardly any of them have ever set foot in pakistan . a hindu refugee widow , who receives a monthly pension of £2 , walks in surej chak . the community live in poverty , while kashmir is one of india 's more prosperous states . activist labha ram gandhi said : ' granting us state-subject rights is the only way to improve our condition ' . with a hindu nationalist party winning a share of power in kashmir , there is hope . bharatiya janata party are expected to champion the refugees ' cause . but a veteran activist labha ram ghandi warned the community is not afraid to take matters into their own hands . suspected rebels shot dead three unarmed policemen monday in the disputed himalayan region of kashmir . the three policemen were investigating a dispute between neighbours when they were fired on by at least three militants wearing army uniforms , officials said . in a separate attack , another officer was critically wounded after suspected militants shot at him inside a bus near northern pattan town , police said . no rebel group immediately claimed responsibility for either attack . kashmir has been in conflict for decades , with rebels fighting either for independence or a merger with neighboring pakistan , which also claims the territory in its entirety while administering part of it . source : associated press . and despite prevailing unrest from different factions , who either fight for independence or to merge once again with pakistan , kashmir is one of india 's more prosperous states . yet the estimated 18,000 wpr families however live in abject poverty , mostly marrying among themselves because of their low economic status . ' i spend whatever money i earn to send my children to school , '' said ramesh kumar , a part-time driver who lives with his wife , two children and mother in a two-room hovel . he says he thinks the law is ‘ridiculous’ , adding : ‘ i was born here ( in india ) . my roots are here . what else do i and my children need to be citizens of this place ? ’ as things stand , kumar 's children can not be admitted to state-run training colleges or be employed in the state government , although they can work for the federal one . but the tide may soon turn on the rights given to refugees , after a pledge by the newly-elected bharatiya janata party to normalise the wprs ' status . although the bjp came second in the december hustings , they have joined a kashmir governing coalition for the first time and are expected to champion the wprs ' cause .

' but he warned the community is ready to take matters into their own hands if their hopes are dashed again . ‘ we will spill our blood on the streets for our rights , ’ he says . the daughter of a hindu refugee studies in her slum home in surej chak . under the current laws she is not allowed to enrolled at a state-run training college or be employed by the state government . such laws , argue opponents , make these families ' second class citizens ' .","82-year-old Mangu Ram, a Hindu traditional healer, has been living as a refugee in Indian Kashmir for nearly 70 years after fleeing violence during the partition of India. Despite being born in an area that is now part of Pakistan but was within India's boundaries before independence, Ram and others like him, known as West Pakistan Refugees (WPRs), have been denied citizenship rights in Kashmir, including property ownership and voting in state elections. This has left three generations of WPRs in abject poverty.

The recent success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in winning a share of power in Kashmir has sparked hope among the WPRs. The BJP is expected to advocate for the refugees' cause, potentially leading to the normalization of their status and the granting of state-subject rights, which would significantly improve their living conditions.

The WPRs' situation is complicated by the special autonomy of Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, and the ongoing conflict with Pakistan over the territory. Successive state governments have been reluctant to grant full rights to the WPRs, fearing it would upset the demographic balance between the Muslim and Hindu populations. The WPRs are not recognized as citizens due to a pre-independence law that limits citizenship to those born in the old undivided kingdom of Kashmir and their descendants.

Despite Kashmir's relative prosperity, the WPRs live in poverty, with limited opportunities for education and employment. Activists like Labha Ram Gandhi emphasize that granting state-subject rights is crucial for improving their condition. There is a warning that if their hopes for change are not realized, the community may resort to drastic measures to claim their rights.

In summary, the passage discusses the plight of the WPRs in Indian Kashmir, their lack of citizenship rights, and the newfound hope brought by the BJP's recent political victory, which could lead to the recognition of their rights and a chance to escape poverty.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.41845,0.63261,0.74027,1,1.0

The passage highlights the performances of Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell for Toulon as evidence that players can improve abroad and deserve selection for their national teams. Steffon Armitage and Nick Abendanon are also cited as examples of English players who have enhanced their games since moving to France, with the implication that their exclusion from the English squad is detrimental to the team's prospects.

Open Garden's FireChat app enables users to chat with friends without an internet or mobile connection by utilizing wireless mesh networks, which has been downloaded over five million times since its launch.
2. The app leverages Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF) in iOS 7 and a similar feature on Android over Bluetooth, allowing users to send messages and photos within a localized network where each phone acts as a node.
3. FireChat offers two types of chatrooms: ""everyone"" and ""nearby,"" with the former connecting to all users and the latter to those within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range.
4. Messages in FireChat are secure and can be sent anonymously, with the app's design preventing hacker infiltration due to the lack of an internet connection.

' i really think we - and by `` we '' i mean nice people and body-positivity - are winning , ' she said .","Lillian Bustle, a burlesque performer from New Jersey, is on a mission to reclaim the word 'fat' as a neutral, body-positive descriptor. During a TED Talk, she emphasized that 'fat' should not be equated with 'ugly' and pointed out that it is just one of many factual descriptors she uses for herself, alongside 'short' and 'wife'. Despite societal stigma, Lillian believes that 'fat' is not inherently negative.

She highlighted the prevalence of size discrimination, noting a 66% increase in workplace discrimination based on size over the past 30 years. Additionally, she cited a study indicating that the top wish among girls aged 11 to 17 is to be thinner. However, Lillian also referenced research showing that exposure to body diversity can lead to greater acceptance and even preference for different body types.

Through her burlesque performances, Lillian aims to expose audiences to a positive and glamorous representation of a 'fat' body, challenging societal norms of desirability. She shared that her own experience with burlesque, which began in 2012, has been empowering and body-positive, helping her overcome insecurities about her body.

Lillian's TED Talk, which was posted on YouTube three weeks prior, has garnered nearly 38,000 views and mostly positive feedback.

the schoolboy was skiing with his family when he became separated from his mother and headed into dense woodland where he fell over a 164ft drop .
tragedy : carwyn scott-howell ( left ; right ) fell to his death while on holiday with his mother ceri , nine-year-old sister antonia and brother gerwyn , 19 , in the alps
footprints in the snow eventually led police to his body , investigators revealed last night .
they also described how the boy 's mother cari , 44 , desperately tried to find her missing son .
in a moving tribute , carwyn 's family described how he ` made life full of laughter with never a dull moment ' .
` seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky , ' they added .
` carwyn was an adorable , caring person who gave so much love .

carwyn , from talybont-on-usk in wales , was said to have been a ` very competent skier and snowboarder ' who had started skiing at the age of three .
the family said they had spent ` the most happy ski holiday together ' in the resort of flaine in the days before the tragedy stuck .
they were enjoying their last run of the day when the boy 's sister antonia , nine , lost her ski on a jump and carwyn pressed on ahead .
his mother stopped to help her daughter and continued to the bottom of the piste .
but carwyn -- who modelled himself on the tv adventurer bear grylls -- was nowhere to be seen .
mrs scott-howell returned to their hotel believing her son had made his own way back , but returned to the mountain when she found he was n't there .
pierre-yves michau , the judge heading the investigation , said yesterday : ` she asked everyone if they had seen him . '
it is believed carwyn left the piste and entered woodland because he had spotted the resort through the trees .
taking off his skis , he continued on foot as he hurried to get there .
police chief michel ollagnon confirmed that officers had been led to the boy 's body by footprints in the snow .
he said the final steps were broken up by ` sliding marks ' where carwyn had tackled the sharper inclines on his backside .

Carwyn was characterized as a daring, outgoing, and determined child with a charming smile that brightened any room. He was an experienced skier and snowboarder, having started at age three. During a family ski holiday in Flaine, Carwyn became separated from his mother when his sister lost a ski, and he ventured ahead alone. When his mother, Ceri, could not find him at their hotel, she realized he was missing and began a desperate search.

Investigators found that Carwyn had left the marked ski trail and entered dense woodland, likely attempting to reach the resort he could see through the trees. His body was eventually located following footprints in the snow, with evidence suggesting he had slid down steeper sections on his backside.

"just 13 and in the grip of a terrifying obsession surviving on just one piece of fruit a day , anorexic schoolgirl laura scurr 's body started to shut down .
the 15-year-old , from whitley bay , was left on a heart machine after she collapsed through starvation but has now spoken about pressures put on teenagers to be a ` size zero ' .
laura became so obsessed with having the perfect figure she would hide food down the side of her bed , lying to her mother about eating and sometimes surviving on just a piece of fruit a day .
laura scurr , 15 , has spoken out about the pressures on young girls to be a size zero after , having becoming obsessed with her own weight , she developed anorexia
but her dramatic weight loss led to horrific consequences when she suddenly collapsed at her family home and was rushed to intensive care .
laura has spoken about her two-year fight with anorexia and revealed the pressures she felt to be thin .
she said : ` at the worst point i was hiding food down the sides of the settee or beds , lying to my mum about having meals , and eating about 100 calories a day .
` i would even try to have mashed potato with each meal so i could hide the rest of the food under it , that way it looked like i 'd ate more . '
after spending a week on a heart monitor at north tyneside general hospital , laura was finally offered support from eating disorder organisations as she began her recovery .
problems started for the teen two years ago when she decided she wanted to go on a diet .
` i was nearly 13 stone and felt like i was too big , ' laura said .
` i 'd been bullied a little bit because of my weight , people saying things like ` here comes the whale ' and that made me feel horrible .
laura was living off just one piece of fruit a day and would hide her food down the side of her bed so her parents would n't see it
laura continued : ` i would look around at the other girls and they all seemed to be skinny and , of course , i wanted to be like them and fit into all the different types of clothes .
` but it was n't just people i knew .
i felt there was a lot of pressures from all over the place .
everywhere you looked there seemed to be this idea that girls should be a size zero . '
laura agreed with mum sue , 48 , to go on a ` sensible diet ' but soon the whitley bay high school pupil became frustrated , wanting to lose more weight , quicker .
according to the nhs anorexia or anorexia nervosa , to give its full name , is a serious mental health condition in which people try to keep their body weight as low as possible .
it is often said that people will often restrict their intake of food , make themselves vomit or increase the amount of exercise they are doing .
the condition often develops in people who are anxious about their body shape or weight , or in those who fear being fat or wish to be thin .
anorexia most commonly occurs in women , starting around the age of 16 or 17 .
although there are cases of men suffering from the disease too .
often people suffering from anorexia will obsessively count calories , take laxatives and repeatedly weight themselves or check their bodies in the mirror .
if you think you know someone who is suffering from the disease talk to them gently about it .
often it can be hard for them to seek help .
you can also seek advice from an eating disorder charity such as beat , who will be able to talk you through how to help them and how to handle the situation .
in february 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the uk - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia .
` it was coming off quite slowly , at about 2 lbs a week , ' said laura .
` but i became much more obsessive about it and decided to reduce my calorie intake .
` in the end , i was virtually eating nothing , maybe an apple or orange a day .
` i could tell my parents were getting worried , they could n't understand why i did n't want to eat . '
lack of food soon took its toll on laura 's health and her heart rate started slowing .
she said : ` i was in bed for three or four days , never going out of the house .
` i would feel dizzy or pass out because my heart rate was so slow . '
finally after a week of eating virtually nothing , laura collapsed .
no happy and healthy laura has made it to the semi final of miss teen gb , the competition aims to stay away from size zero stereotypes
sue , who works in sales , said : ` an ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital and put on the heart monitor for a week .
her body had just started to shut down .
` it was frightening , i was shocked that this was happening to my daughter .
` i remember sitting by her hospital bed and saying "" laura , do you realise how sick you are ? ""
but she just said "" i do n't care , as long as i 'm skinny "" .
` it was then i realised just how much pressure she , and all girls , were under to look a certain way . '
after getting discharged laura began working with eating disorder teams ( edict ) and child and adolescent mental health services ( camhs ) to help in her recovery .
today , her body image is better than ever and her new-found confidence has allowed her to make it through to the semi final of miss teen gb .
the contest aims to promote ` positive and confidence-building experiences ' for young girls , away from size zero stereotypes .","13-year-old Laura Scurr from Whitley Bay developed anorexia nervosa due to a desire to be thin and fit into societal expectations of a 'size zero' figure. She began hiding food and consuming as little as one piece of fruit a day, leading to a dramatic weight loss. Laura's condition deteriorated to the point where her body began to shut down, and she was hospitalized, requiring a heart monitor. Her mother, Sue, recounts the terrifying experience of Laura's hospitalization and her daughter's fixation on being skinny despite her illness.

Laura's struggle with anorexia started when she was nearly 13 stone and faced bullying about her weight. She felt pressured by the perceived ideal body image portrayed by other girls and media. Despite initially agreeing to a sensible diet with her mother, Laura became more obsessive about her weight, severely restricting her calorie intake.

Anorexia nervosa is characterized by attempts to maintain a low body weight and is associated with an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. It commonly occurs in women around the age of 16 or 17, though it can affect men as well. Sufferers may engage in behaviors such as calorie counting, vomiting, and excessive exercise.

Laura's health rapidly declined, and she experienced slowing of her heart rate, dizziness, and fainting spells. After collapsing from lack of nutrition, she was hospitalized and received support from eating disorder organizations, including EDICT and CAMHS, which aided her recovery.

Now, Laura has regained her health and confidence, reaching the semi-finals of Miss Teen GB, a competition that promotes positive body image and moves away from size zero stereotypes. Her experience highlights the dangers of eating disorders and the societal pressures that can contribute to them.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.78809,0.93782,0.97497,1,1.0

"the largest single high-definition map of mysterious dark matter has been produced .
it is the first in a series of maps of the cosmos that will eventually allow a 3d view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky .
and the map should allow astronomers to study how galaxies formed in the universe .
university of manchester researchers have revealed an hd dark matter map ( shown ) .
it shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4 per cent of the sky .
the goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years .
red here shows more dark matter , and blue shows less .
the moon is shown top left for scale
a team from the university of manchester , led by dr sarah bridle , has spent the past two years measuring the shapes of galaxies used to construct the map .
and the map was released today at the april meeting of the american physical society in baltimore , maryland .
it was created using data captured by the dark energy camera , a 570-megapixel imaging device that is the primary instrument for the dark energy survey ( des ) led by fermilab in the us .
the survey uses the 13ft ( four metres ) victor m. blanco telescope located at the cerro tololo inter-american observatory ( ctio ) in chile .
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery .
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces .
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force .
called ` dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe .
and the project is run overall as part of the five-year dark energy survey ( des ) , and is the largest map of this detail .
of course , we ca n't actually directly observe dark matter yet - so the survey instead looks for its noticeable effect on galaxies .
studying this enables the predicted amounts of dark matter in a given area to be mapped , based on its gravitational effects .
` dark matter could equally be called "" transparent matter "" , because we see things behind it that gets distorted by gravity , ' dr bridle told mailonline .
in the map she explained we 're seeing about 150 times the area of the full moon , which is about 0.4 per cent of the whole sky .
the goal of the des is to map 12.5 per cent of the entire sky , creating a 3d map of dark matter - and dark energy .
` it is amazing to see a map of the dark matter over such a large region of the sky , and the full dark energy survey mass map will be more than 30 times bigger still , ' dr bridle said in a separate statement .
` analysis of the clumpiness of the dark matter in the maps will also allow us to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy , believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up . '
this mosaic image shows the different telescope shots that were combined to make the dark matter map .
the survey has just completed its second year .
as scientists expand their search they 'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter
the survey has just completed its second year .
as scientists expand their search , they 'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter .
those theories suggest that , since there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible matter , galaxies will form where there are large concentrations of dark matter ( and hence stronger gravity ) present .
so far , the des analysis backs this up .
the maps show large filaments of matter along which visible galaxies and galaxy clusters lie and cosmic voids where very few galaxies reside .
follow-up studies of some of the enormous filaments and voids , and the enormous volume of data , collected throughout the survey will reveal more about this interplay of mass and light .
these maps show how the amount of dark matter corresponds to the formation rate of galaxies .
on the left , galaxies can be seen near dark matter clumps ( in red ) , and further away from sparse regions ( blue ) .
the image on the right shows some of the regions of sky that were studied
the team at manchester analysed 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies to make the map .
the process of measuring the galaxies is so complex and time consuming that some of the world 's largest supercomputers are needed to do it .
each time a new catalogue is made it takes about as much computing power as running 500 ordinary desktop computers for two weeks .
` we have to measure the shape of each galaxy - how distorted it is - with extremely high precision , about one part in 1000 , ' said dr joe zuntz , also of the university of manchester , who has been making the measurements .
the survey uses the 13ft ( four metres ) victor m. blanco telescope ( middle ) located at the cerro tololo inter-american observatory ( ctio ) in chile , outfitted with a newly designed , state-of-the-art dark energy camera ( decam ) .
it will be completed by 2018 , mapping dark matter of an eighth of the sky in the process
dark matter , the mysterious substance that makes up 85 per cent of all matter in the universe , is invisible to even the most sensitive astronomical instruments because it does not emit or block light .
but its effects can be seen using a technique called gravitational lensing - studying the distortion that occurs when the gravitational pull of dark matter bends light around distant galaxies .
understanding how the clumpiness of dark matter changes with time will reveal the nature of the enigmatic dark energy , which is the ultimate goal of the survey .
the dark matter map released makes use of early des observations and covers only about three percent of the area of sky des will document over its five-year mission .","The passage describes the creation of the largest high-definition map of dark matter, which is part of a series of maps aiming to provide a 3D view of dark matter across 12.5% of the night sky over five years. The map, which covers 0.4% of the sky and shows clumps of dark matter particles, was produced by researchers from the University of Manchester led by Dr. Sarah Bridle. It was constructed over two years by measuring the shapes of galaxies using data from the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel device mounted on the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile.

Dark matter, which constitutes at least 80-85% of the universe's matter, is invisible but its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation of galaxies. The map was released at the American Physical Society meeting and reveals the distribution of dark matter by observing its gravitational lensing effect on light from distant galaxies. The Dark Energy Survey, which includes this map, aims to study the formation of galaxies and the nature of dark energy, which is thought to be causing the universe's expansion to accelerate.

The current map is a small fraction of the eventual coverage, and further analysis of the data will test cosmological theories about the relationship between dark matter concentrations and galaxy formation. The process of creating the map is highly complex, requiring the use of supercomputers to measure galaxy shapes with high precision. The survey will continue to use the Blanco Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera to complete the mapping of dark matter across an eighth of the sky by 2018.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.68953,0.85398,0.93117,1,1.0

"manchester united have ramped up their efforts to sign psv eindhoven star memphis depay by making an official approach for the 21-year-old .
the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .
van gaal is already familiar with the qualities of depay having named him in his 23-man world cup squad last year as holland finished third in brazil .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .

the 21-year-old took his tally to 20 on saturday psv eindhoven beat heerenveen 4-1 to win the dutch championship on saturday for the first time in seven seasons .
the dutch league 's leading scorer doubled the hosts ' lead midway through the first half with a stunning free kick after luuk de jong headed them ahead early on .
heerenveen midfielder joey van den berg pulled a goal back for his side before de jong restored the two-goal advantage just before half-time and luciano narsingh added a fourth late on .
it is a 22nd league championship for psv , who are second only to ajax ( 33 titles ) in holland .
psv eindhoven won there first eredivisie title in seven years after beating heerenveen 4-1 on saturday
depay ( right ) celebrates the dutch giants ' success with manager phillip cocu after the match
born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-20 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.
having impressed in brazil , depay was nominated for the tournament 's ` best young player ' award but lost out to france midfielder paul pogba .

PSV has confirmed the approach from the Red Devils, with manager Louis van Gaal, who previously coached Depay during the 2014 World Cup, eager to secure him as one of his first summer signings. Depay, who has scored 20 goals in 26 league games this season, played a key role in helping the Netherlands finish third in the World Cup and was also part of the PSV team that recently won the Dutch championship for the first time in seven years.

Depay's impressive performances have attracted interest from several top European clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, with PSV's technical director acknowledging contact from these clubs and indicating that the bids are significantly higher than the £15 million offer from Tottenham last summer. Depay's skill set includes pace, close control, and an ability to score from distance, although he is still developing and can sometimes be prone to errors in decision-making.

High praise has come from various quarters, with PSV manager Phillip Cocu suggesting Depay could match the talent of Arjen Robben, and Ed van Steijn, the scout who discovered Cristiano Ronaldo, claiming Depay is superior to Ronaldo was at the same age. Depay's international career is also notable, having scored for the Netherlands at the World Cup and being nominated for the tournament's best young player award.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.52891,0.90212,0.60258,1,1.0

mediation is scheduled for tomorrow morning but if the parties do n't reach an agreement then the case is set for trial in july .
they just want an apology : the couple 's lawyer said that at the very least her client wants an apology from james evans of premiere photos and that it is n't about money","A couple from Texas who got married in 2012 allege that their wedding photographer, James Evans of Premier Photos, printed racial slurs on photo booth pictures from their wedding. The slur in question was ""poor n***** party."" The couple, who wish to remain anonymous, did not discover the offensive language until months later when the bride's sister informed them. The sister had chosen not to tell them earlier to avoid ruining the wedding day.

Upon learning about the incident, the groom contacted Evans, who reportedly responded with ""sue me."" The couple's attorney, Cathy Hale, stated that her clients were initially reluctant to sue but decided to take legal action after Evans failed to address the issue. They are suing under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act for negligence and breach of contract.

Evans and his attorney, Christine Kirchner, have denied the allegations and claimed there is no evidence linking Premier Photos to the offensive caption. Evans also suggested that the couple did not show signs of mental anguish. However, Hale asserts that her clients are seeking an apology and that the lawsuit is not about financial gain. Mediation is scheduled, and if an agreement is not reached, the case will go to trial in July.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.94691,0.94703,0.69977,1,1.0

the england full-back remains unsure when he will return after pulling out of harlequins ' aviva premiership clash with saracens at wembley last weekend .

england full back mike brown admits he is unsure when he will return to action for club side harlequins
brown is determined not to suffer an extended break - so will not rush himself back to action ahead of time .
` it was just after the france game , there was n't one incident where i was dizzy or concussed , but after the game i just did n't feel quite right , ' said brown .
` i had a headache the sunday and monday , so just being cautious with it , i do n't want to get into the situation where you get a few knockouts or something .
` you do n't want to be into a situation where you 're out for a long time like johnny sexton or geoff parling or something like that .
` so with what 's coming up at the end of the year , everyone 's being cautious , and i 'm being cautious as well .
george north will not play against clermont auvergne on saturday and will see a neurosurgeon
north suffered his fourth quick-fire concussion after being knocked out against wasps on friday night
` i think it 's just ongoing to see how i am stage by stage .
` i 'll just see how i am with the stages , do the 20-minute bike , see how i am after that and take it from there . '
brown was knocked out cold in england 's 47-17 victory over italy at twickenham in the second round of rbs 6 nations action in february .
the harlequins flyer had hoped to recover in time to face ireland in dublin on march 1 , but pulled out in the build-up .
brown said increased awareness of the symptoms of concussion , driven by players undergoing world rugby online modules , helped him realise he would not be ready to face ireland .

` learning about all the symptoms was massive , ' said brown , speaking for land rover 's ` we deal in real ' campaign .
` i pulled out on the tuesday before the ireland game with the symptoms , and i could maybe have tried to carry on with training , but being aware of the symptoms was important .
` so just knowing the dangers of the long and short-term dangers , how important it is to be honest and how serious it can be , i think those are the main things i took from the online courses .
` after the france game i had a headache and could ( have ) easily thought "" it 's sarries , it 's wembley and i 'll give it a go "" , but we 're so clued up on it now that i do n't think anyone would risk it .
brown ( right ) says he suffered a headache after playing in england 's clash against france last month
` if i can do it , pulling out of england-ireland , the biggest game of the six nations at that point , then i think anyone can do it , and should do it .
` now i 've been through it i would definitely talk to team-mates urging them not to play on if i thought they were showing symptoms .
` at the time you think it 's a pain but now i 'm very glad i took those online modules .
` it 's just not worth pushing through . '
land rover ambassador mike brown was speaking at the launch of ` we deal in real ' , land rover 's rugby world cup 2032 campaign that champions people at the heart and soul of the game by putting grassroots clubs on the global stage .","Mike Brown, an England full-back, is taking a cautious approach to his recovery from a recent concussion. He is uncertain about his return date after withdrawing from Harlequins' match against Saracens. Brown's caution is influenced by the experiences of other players, such as George North and Johnny Sexton, who have faced significant time out due to concussions. North has been advised not to play for the rest of the season following four concussions in quick succession, while Sexton was sidelined for 12 weeks.

Brown described feeling unwell after the game against France, experiencing a headache that persisted for two days, which prompted his decision to be cautious. He emphasized the importance of not rushing his return to avoid a long-term absence similar to that of Sexton or Geoff Parling. Brown is following a stage-by-stage recovery process, starting with light exercise and monitoring his symptoms.

Previously, Brown was knocked out during England's match against Italy in February and had to withdraw from the game against Ireland in March. He credits increased awareness of concussion symptoms, partly due to World Rugby's online modules, for helping him recognize the need to pull out of the Ireland match. Brown stresses the importance of being honest about symptoms and not risking further injury by playing through them.

Brown, as an ambassador for Land Rover, spoke about the importance of education on concussion symptoms and the impact of the online courses he completed. He encourages other players to prioritize their health and not play on if they exhibit symptoms of concussion. His experience has reinforced the message that it is not worth pushing through potential head injuries.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.57144,0.60105,0.48364,1,1.0
"smartphone use may be to blame for a drop in the number of times couples are having sex each month , a leading expert has suggested .

this was compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990 , according to research published in prof spiegelhalter 's book sex by numbers .
according to the daily telegraph he told bbc radio 15 's woman 's hour programme : ` we used to have a very big separation between our public lives and our private lives - now they are so mixed up and integrated .
` people are checking their emails all the time , you do not have the same sort of quiet empty time that there used to be . '
in his book , prof spiegelhalter pointed to a number of possible factors for the decline in sexual activity with one possible explanation being that more people are living on their own .
passion killed : people are check their emails ` all the time ' , according to professor david spiegelhalter , a statistician at cambridge university ( file picture )
but he added : ` a more realistic explanation is that as we 've become better connected technologically , our lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home , work and the outside world .
this has squeezed out time we would have spent with our other halves .
the statistician quotes catherine mercer , a researcher on the british national survey , as saying : ` with an increasing number of competing demands on our time , sex just falls down our list of priorities . '
she adds that dealing with work emails late in the evening can mean that ` come bedtime , we 're just still too connected with everyone and everything out there to be able to focus just on our partner . '","A leading expert, Professor David Spiegelhalter from Cambridge University, has suggested that the increase in smartphone use may be contributing to a decrease in the frequency of sexual activity among couples. According to research cited in his book ""Sex by Numbers,"" the average number of times a typical heterosexual couple in Britain has sex has declined from five times a month in 1990 to three times a month currently. This trend correlates with the rise of the internet and the increasing integration of public and private life. Spiegelhalter notes that constant connectivity, such as checking emails frequently, has filled what used to be quiet downtime, leaving less time for intimacy. He also points out that more people living alone and the blurring of lines between home, work, and the outside world due to technological advancements have led to busier lives, which in turn has reduced the time available for sexual activity. Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, is quoted in the book, emphasizing that with the increasing demands on our time, sex has become a lower priority, and the habit of dealing with work emails late into the evening can further detract from intimate partner interactions at bedtime.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.94815,0.92402,0.98953,1,1.0
"big beauty : tibetan mastiffs can weigh 80 kg
just a year ago they could command prices of up to £ 1.2 million each .
but tibetan mastiffs are now so unpopular in china they are being sent to slaughterhouses -- and their meat put into cheap hotpots .
the dogs ' dramatic decline in fortune is being partly blamed on the chinese government 's wide-reaching anti-corruption crackdown .
previously , wealthy businessmen would give the prized mastiffs to officials in the hope of influencing their decisions .
luo yi , general manager of china 's largest tibetan mastiff puppy farm , told people 's daily online : ` the anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift . '
it is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50 kg in several chinese cities - including beijing , zhengzhou , shanghai and tianjin - has had a huge impact on the breed 's popularity .
tibetan mastiffs -- which were traditionally used in tibet to herd other animals and are known for their loyalty - can weigh up to 80 kg .
china 's mastiff market collapse was revealed after animal-welfare workers rescued a group of the dogs that were being transported to a slaughterhouse .
the abattoir they were heading to provides hotpot meat for restaurants .
the dogs ' skin can also be used for leather belts .
rescuers said they found the 20 mastiffs in cramped cages .
a third of the dogs were already dead and none had been given food or water for three days .
several were suffering from broken bones .
shocking trade : twenty tibetan mastiffs were recently found crammed into cages on their way to a slaughterhouse like the dogs in this picture - taken on a motorway in the chinese capital beijing in 2009
it is feared that across china hundreds of the dogs are meeting such a cruel fate .
mastiffs are also being stolen from the streets by ruthless gangs , who sell them to the slaughterhouses , say animal charities .
unscrupulous breeders are also offloading their ` imperfect ' specimens to the abattoirs .
luo yi , whose puppy farm is in tibet , said some of his fellow breeders had damaged the quality of the breed to make more money .
` driven by profits there was a lot of cross-breeding which resulted in a deterioration of the tibetan mastiff in terms of appearance as well as temperament , ' he explained .
there was now a glut of poor-quality dogs that ca n't be sold , he added .
loyal : tibetan mastiffs , like the one here , were originally used by people in tibet to herd other animals
in their heyday : a visitor plays with one of the dogs at a tibetan mastiff show in shenyang city four years ago
meanwhile , chen youjun a specialist in tibetan mastiff photography , said : ` the rapid pace of urbanisation across china has made more and more people now realise tibetan mastiffs are not animals well-suited to city living . '
the breed 's boom began in 2005 and led to the dogs being seen as status symbols .
just 13 months ago one puppy sold for £ 1.2 million , which is thought to be the highest price ever paid for a dog .
a property develop bought the golden-haired one-year-old from breeder zhang gengyun in the eastern province of zhejiang .
mr zhang said of his dogs : ` they have lion 's blood and are top-of-the-range mastiff studs . '
most expensive dog in the world : the gold-maned tibetan mastiff pup ( left ) sold last year in east china for £ 1.2 million .
the red pup of the same breed ( right ) fetched nearly £ 600,017 .
the dogs are seen with a model","Tibetan mastiffs, large dogs that can weigh up to 80 kg, were once highly valued in China, with prices reaching up to £1.2 million. They were traditionally used for herding in Tibet and are known for their loyalty. However, their popularity has plummeted due to the Chinese government's anti-corruption campaign, which has discouraged the practice of giving these dogs as lavish gifts to influence officials. Additionally, bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several Chinese cities have further diminished their appeal.

The collapse of the mastiff market was highlighted when animal welfare workers rescued a group of Tibetan mastiffs en route to a slaughterhouse, where they were to be used for cheap hotpot meat and their skins for leather belts. The dogs were found in inhumane conditions, with many already dead from neglect and suffering from injuries.

The breed's downfall has also been attributed to unethical breeding practices, with breeders cross-breeding for profit, leading to a decline in the quality of the dogs. This has resulted in an oversupply of mastiffs that are considered imperfect and unsellable, leading to their disposal in slaughterhouses. Furthermore, thefts by gangs and the offloading of unsellable dogs by breeders have contributed to the cruel treatment of these animals.

Urbanization in China has also made it clear that Tibetan mastiffs are not well-suited for city living. Despite their previous status as symbols of wealth and prestige, with record-breaking sale prices, the market for these dogs has significantly deteriorated.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.88721,0.62839,0.41566,1,1.0

"manchester united have ramped up their efforts to sign psv eindhoven star memphis depay by making an official approach for the 21-year-old .
the eredivisie champions have confirmed that the red devils have made a move over the holland international - with united manager louis van gaal keen to make him one of his first signings this summer .
van gaal is already familiar with the qualities of depay having named him in his 23-man world cup squad last year as holland finished third in brazil .

premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their £ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .

the dutch league 's leading scorer doubled the hosts ' lead midway through the first half with a stunning free kick after luuk de jong headed them ahead early on .
heerenveen midfielder joey van den berg pulled a goal back for his side before de jong restored the two-goal advantage just before half-time and luciano narsingh added a fourth late on .

psv eindhoven won there first eredivisie title in seven years after beating heerenveen 4-1 on saturday
depay ( right ) celebrates the dutch giants ' success with manager phillip cocu after the match
born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-13 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.
having impressed in brazil , depay was nominated for the tournament 's ` best young player ' award but lost out to france midfielder paul pogba .
click here to read sportsmail 's full background article about memphis depay .","Manchester United have intensified their pursuit of PSV Eindhoven's Memphis Depay by making an official bid for the 21-year-old winger. PSV has confirmed the approach from the Red Devils, with manager Louis van Gaal, who previously coached Depay during the 2014 World Cup, eager to secure him as one of his first summer signings. Depay, who has scored 20 goals in 26 league games this season, played a key role in helping the Netherlands finish third in the World Cup and was part of van Gaal's squad.

PSV's technical director, Marcel Brands, has revealed that United are not the only club interested in Depay, with Paris Saint-Germain and another unnamed big European club also in the running. The bid amounts are reportedly higher than the £15 million offer Tottenham made last summer, which was rejected.

Depay's talents have been highly praised, with comparisons drawn to Arjen Robben and even Cristiano Ronaldo, with some believing he could surpass Ronaldo's achievements. The youngster has been recognized for his pace, dribbling skills, and ability to score from distance, although he is still developing and can sometimes make poor decisions on the field.

Depay has been with PSV since the age of 12 and has made over 100 appearances for the club, contributing to their recent Eredivisie title win, their first in seven years. His performances have not only attracted the attention of top clubs but also earned him accolades, including a nomination for the World Cup's best young player award.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.47787,0.81647,0.32911,1,1.0

Tammy Abraham was the standout player, scoring two goals in the first half to give Chelsea the lead. Dominic Solanke added a third goal late in the game to seal the win.

For Manchester City, Isaac Buckley-Ricketts managed to equalize briefly in the first half, but overall, Chelsea's attack proved too strong. Chelsea's defense, featuring players like Fikayo Tomori and Jake Clarke-Salter, effectively contained City's offensive efforts.

Chelsea's midfield, with Charlie Colkett and Ruben Sammut, controlled the game, while Ola Aina provided consistent threat from the right flank. Despite a few individual bright moments from City players like Brandon Barker and Tosin Adarabioyo, Chelsea's performance was dominant.

Kasey Palmer, who replaced the injured Abraham, also showcased his pace after coming on.

rolling green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the alps as their open-ended odyssey continued
when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .

"mike brown admitted he would adopt a ` cautious ' approach in recovering from his latest concussion setback .
the england full-back remains unsure when he will return after pulling out of harlequins ' aviva premiership clash with saracens at wembley last weekend .
northampton wing george north has been advised by leading medics not to play again this season after suffering four quick-fire concussions , while ireland 's johnny sexton was stood down for 12 weeks earlier this term .
england full back mike brown admits he is unsure when he will return to action for club side harlequins
brown is determined not to suffer an extended break - so will not rush himself back to action ahead of time .
` it was just after the france game , there was n't one incident where i was dizzy or concussed , but after the game i just did n't feel quite right , ' said brown .
` i had a headache the sunday and monday , so just being cautious with it , i do n't want to get into the situation where you get a few knockouts or something .
` you do n't want to be into a situation where you 're out for a long time like johnny sexton or geoff parling or something like that .
` so with what 's coming up at the end of the year , everyone 's being cautious , and i 'm being cautious as well .
george north will not play against clermont auvergne on saturday and will see a neurosurgeon
north suffered his fourth quick-fire concussion after being knocked out against wasps on friday night
` i think it 's just ongoing to see how i am stage by stage .
` i 'll just see how i am with the stages , do the 20-minute bike , see how i am after that and take it from there . '
brown was knocked out cold in england 's 47-17 victory over italy at twickenham in the second round of rbs 6 nations action in february .
the harlequins flyer had hoped to recover in time to face ireland in dublin on march 1 , but pulled out in the build-up .
brown said increased awareness of the symptoms of concussion , driven by players undergoing world rugby online modules , helped him realise he would not be ready to face ireland .

` learning about all the symptoms was massive , ' said brown , speaking for land rover 's ` we deal in real ' campaign .
` i pulled out on the tuesday before the ireland game with the symptoms , and i could maybe have tried to carry on with training , but being aware of the symptoms was important .
` so just knowing the dangers of the long and short-term dangers , how important it is to be honest and how serious it can be , i think those are the main things i took from the online courses .
` after the france game i had a headache and could ( have ) easily thought "" it 's sarries , it 's wembley and i 'll give it a go "" , but we 're so clued up on it now that i do n't think anyone would risk it .
brown ( right ) says he suffered a headache after playing in england 's clash against france last month
` if i can do it , pulling out of england-ireland , the biggest game of the six nations at that point , then i think anyone can do it , and should do it .
` now i 've been through it i would definitely talk to team-mates urging them not to play on if i thought they were showing symptoms .
` at the time you think it 's a pain but now i 'm very glad i took those online modules .
` it 's just not worth pushing through . '
land rover ambassador mike brown was speaking at the launch of ` we deal in real ' , land rover 's rugby world cup 2028 campaign that champions people at the heart and soul of the game by putting grassroots clubs on the global stage .","Mike Brown, an England full-back, is taking a cautious approach to his recovery from a recent concussion. He is uncertain about his return date after withdrawing from Harlequins' match against Saracens. Brown's caution is influenced by the experiences of other players, such as George North, who has been advised not to play for the rest of the season due to multiple concussions, and Johnny Sexton, who was sidelined for 12 weeks. Brown emphasizes the importance of not rushing back to avoid a long-term absence like Sexton's or Geoff Parling's.

Brown's concussion symptoms appeared after the game against France, with headaches persisting for a couple of days, prompting him to be cautious. He was also knocked out during England's match against Italy in February and had to withdraw from the Ireland game in March. Increased awareness of concussion symptoms, partly due to World Rugby online modules, has made Brown more vigilant about his health. He stresses the importance of recognizing symptoms and being honest about them to avoid long-term risks.

George North, who suffered his fourth concussion in quick succession, will miss the game against Clermont Auvergne and is set to consult a neurosurgeon. Brown, as a Land Rover ambassador, spoke about the importance of education on concussion symptoms and the need to prioritize player safety, even if it means missing significant matches. He is part of Land Rover's 'We Deal in Real' campaign, which aims to support grassroots rugby and highlight the importance of the individuals within the sport.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.56266,0.69728,0.88602,1,1.0
"smartphone use may be to blame for a drop in the number of times couples are having sex each month , a leading expert has suggested .

this was compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990 , according to research published in prof spiegelhalter 's book sex by numbers .
according to the daily telegraph he told bbc radio 10 's woman 's hour programme : ` we used to have a very big separation between our public lives and our private lives - now they are so mixed up and integrated .
` people are checking their emails all the time , you do not have the same sort of quiet empty time that there used to be . '
in his book , prof spiegelhalter pointed to a number of possible factors for the decline in sexual activity with one possible explanation being that more people are living on their own .
passion killed : people are check their emails ` all the time ' , according to professor david spiegelhalter , a statistician at cambridge university ( file picture )
but he added : ` a more realistic explanation is that as we 've become better connected technologically , our lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home , work and the outside world .
this has squeezed out time we would have spent with our other halves .
the statistician quotes catherine mercer , a researcher on the british national survey , as saying : ` with an increasing number of competing demands on our time , sex just falls down our list of priorities . '
she adds that dealing with work emails late in the evening can mean that ` come bedtime , we 're just still too connected with everyone and everything out there to be able to focus just on our partner . '","A leading expert, Professor David Spiegelhalter from Cambridge University, has suggested that the increase in smartphone use may be contributing to a decrease in the frequency of sexual activity among couples. According to research cited in his book ""Sex by Numbers,"" the average number of times a typical heterosexual couple in Britain has sex has declined from five times a month in 1990 to three times a month currently. This trend correlates with the rise of the internet and the increasing integration of public and private life. Spiegelhalter notes that constant connectivity, such as checking emails frequently, has filled what used to be quiet downtime, leaving less time for intimacy. He also points out that more people living alone and the blurring of lines between home, work, and the outside world due to technological advancements have led to busier lives, which in turn has reduced the time available for sexual activity. Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, is quoted in the book, emphasizing that with the increasing demands on our time, sex has become a lower priority, and the habit of dealing with work emails late into the evening can further detract from intimate partner interactions at bedtime.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.94846,0.92462,0.98957,1,1.0
"big beauty : tibetan mastiffs can weigh 80 kg
just a year ago they could command prices of up to £ 1.2 million each .
but tibetan mastiffs are now so unpopular in china they are being sent to slaughterhouses -- and their meat put into cheap hotpots .
the dogs ' dramatic decline in fortune is being partly blamed on the chinese government 's wide-reaching anti-corruption crackdown .
previously , wealthy businessmen would give the prized mastiffs to officials in the hope of influencing their decisions .
luo yi , general manager of china 's largest tibetan mastiff puppy farm , told people 's daily online : ` the anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift . '
it is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50 kg in several chinese cities - including beijing , zhengzhou , shanghai and tianjin - has had a huge impact on the breed 's popularity .
tibetan mastiffs -- which were traditionally used in tibet to herd other animals and are known for their loyalty - can weigh up to 80 kg .
china 's mastiff market collapse was revealed after animal-welfare workers rescued a group of the dogs that were being transported to a slaughterhouse .
the abattoir they were heading to provides hotpot meat for restaurants .
the dogs ' skin can also be used for leather belts .
rescuers said they found the 20 mastiffs in cramped cages .
a third of the dogs were already dead and none had been given food or water for three days .
several were suffering from broken bones .
shocking trade : twenty tibetan mastiffs were recently found crammed into cages on their way to a slaughterhouse like the dogs in this picture - taken on a motorway in the chinese capital beijing in 2009
it is feared that across china hundreds of the dogs are meeting such a cruel fate .
mastiffs are also being stolen from the streets by ruthless gangs , who sell them to the slaughterhouses , say animal charities .
unscrupulous breeders are also offloading their ` imperfect ' specimens to the abattoirs .
luo yi , whose puppy farm is in tibet , said some of his fellow breeders had damaged the quality of the breed to make more money .
` driven by profits there was a lot of cross-breeding which resulted in a deterioration of the tibetan mastiff in terms of appearance as well as temperament , ' he explained .
there was now a glut of poor-quality dogs that ca n't be sold , he added .
loyal : tibetan mastiffs , like the one here , were originally used by people in tibet to herd other animals
in their heyday : a visitor plays with one of the dogs at a tibetan mastiff show in shenyang city four years ago
meanwhile , chen youjun a specialist in tibetan mastiff photography , said : ` the rapid pace of urbanisation across china has made more and more people now realise tibetan mastiffs are not animals well-suited to city living . '
the breed 's boom began in 2005 and led to the dogs being seen as status symbols .
just 13 months ago one puppy sold for £ 1.2 million , which is thought to be the highest price ever paid for a dog .
a property develop bought the golden-haired one-year-old from breeder zhang gengyun in the eastern province of zhejiang .
mr zhang said of his dogs : ` they have lion 's blood and are top-of-the-range mastiff studs . '
most expensive dog in the world : the gold-maned tibetan mastiff pup ( left ) sold last year in east china for £ 1.2 million .
the red pup of the same breed ( right ) fetched nearly £ 600,011 .
the dogs are seen with a model","Tibetan mastiffs, large dogs that can weigh up to 80 kg, were once highly valued in China, with prices reaching up to £1.2 million. They were traditionally used for herding in Tibet and are known for their loyalty. However, their popularity has plummeted due to the Chinese government's anti-corruption campaign, which has discouraged the practice of giving these dogs as lavish gifts to influence officials. Additionally, bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several Chinese cities have further diminished their appeal.

The collapse of the mastiff market was highlighted when animal welfare workers rescued a group of Tibetan mastiffs en route to a slaughterhouse, where they were to be used for cheap hotpot meat and their skins for leather belts. The dogs were found in inhumane conditions, with many already dead from neglect and suffering from injuries.

The breed's downfall has also been attributed to unethical breeding practices, with breeders cross-breeding for profit, leading to a decline in the quality of the dogs. This has resulted in an oversupply of mastiffs that are considered imperfect and unsellable, leading to their disposal in slaughterhouses. Furthermore, thefts by gangs and the offloading of unsellable dogs by breeders have contributed to the cruel treatment of these animals.

Urbanization in China has also made it clear that Tibetan mastiffs are not well-suited for city living. Despite their previous status as symbols of wealth and prestige, with record-breaking sale prices, the breed's popularity has waned significantly, leading to a grim situation for many of these once-prized dogs.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.88875,0.54495,0.39688,1,1.0

aspiring model leonie granger ( left ) has been jailed for 16 years at the old bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler mehmet hassan ( right ) who she lured at a casino
granger ( pictured with mr hassan at palm beach casino in central london ) took advantage of him being a ` soft target ' , the court heard .
judge william kennedy today described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked '
but after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside .
they tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings .
afterwards , they left him with multiple broken bones , lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood .
following a trial at the old bailey , granger was found guilty of mr hassan 's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder .
she was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by judge william kennedy today .
co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , and nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
sentencing , judge william kennedy described the attack as ` pitiless and wicked ' , adding : ` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . '
in mitigation , orlando pownall qc said granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with jackson and ` fell in with his desires ' .
mr pownall said she now ` deeply regretted ' what had happened , adding : ` her head was turned by mr jackson who she loved and to some extent by mr chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming . '
but jailing her , the judge said she had been ` deceitful from the outset ' and had ` lost her sense and compassion ' when she got involved in the scheme .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , from gillingham , kent , used her good looks to befriend the poker player , who showered her with gifts , cash and trips to fancy restaurants .
she wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter
granger and mr hassan are pictured on cctv going in to the palm beach casino in central london together
all the defendants were convicted of robbing mr hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him .
jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .

police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him .

Granger targeted Hassan after seeing him with a roll of £50 notes at a London casino. She used her looks to befriend him, gaining gifts, cash, and fancy dinners in return. Granger facilitated the robbery and murder of Hassan by leaving his flat door unlocked, allowing her boyfriend, Kyrron Jackson, and his accomplice, Nicholas Chandler, to enter and brutally attack Hassan, ultimately leading to his death.

The attack was described as ""pitiless and wicked"" by Judge William Kennedy, who noted Granger's deceitfulness and lack of compassion. Although Granger claimed to have been in love with Jackson and was manipulated by him and Chandler, the judge emphasized her active role in the crime. Jackson and Chandler were convicted of murder and received life sentences with a minimum of 36 years. All three were also found guilty of robbing Hassan and conspiring to falsely imprison him. Additionally, Jackson and Chandler were convicted of plotting to rob casino employees and conspiring to possess firearms.

Hassan, a father of three, was unaware of the plot as he enjoyed evenings with Granger, whom he knew as ""Rachel."" On the night of the murder, after a lavish dinner and a visit to the Palm Beach Casino, Hassan was tied up, beaten, and killed in his Islington flat by Jackson and Chandler, who were seeking his gambling winnings. Despite the brutality of the attack, the killers only fled with £3,000, a TV, and a mobile phone. They were apprehended after Granger's phone records were analyzed.

"( cnn ) he was known as the american mouthpiece of al qaeda , speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that 's devoted blood and resources to attacking it .
the white house announced thursday that adam gadahn , 36 , was killed in january in a u.s. government counterterrorism operation .
neither he nor ahmed farouq -- another u.s. citizen and al qaeda operative who died in what the white house said was "" likely a separate "" operation -- was specifically targeted , according to the statement .
warren weinstein , a u.s. citizen who was abducted by al qaeda in pakistan in 2011 , died along with another hostage , italian giovanni lo porto , in the attack that killed farouq , according to the white house .
white house : u.s. hostage killed in strike on al qaeda
while he was n't one of al qaeda 's top leaders , gadahn was one of its most prominent members , given his many statements on behalf of the organization .
also known as azzam the american , he was born in 1978 .
his parents changed their name from pearlman to gadahn after their marriage .
he grew up on a farm in rural california and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents , who were jewish .
he converted to islam in 1995 and left the united states for pakistan three years later .
his father said gadahn last contacted the family in 2002 .
a former al qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting gadahn at peshawar airport in september 1998 .
gadahn , who 'd just just turned 20 , had taken flights from the united states to london , then on to karachi and peshawar .
the former operative planned to take gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed , before accompanying him by bus to al qaeda 's encampments in afghanistan .
but gadahn told him he 'd been longing for some afghan food , so they went to an afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road .
the former operative said that after gadahn joined al qaeda , he was known as abu suhayb .
in the years after 9/11 , gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of pakistan , becoming its chief official english-language propagandist .
he emerged in the mid-2000s on al qaeda videos , including ones threatening attacks on los angeles and melbourne , australia .
at first he was disguised .
sometimes he spoke in english , but in other videos he spoke in arabic .
he urged muslims to target american , western and jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in pakistan , according to site , a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online .
a federal grand jury in california indicted gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al qaeda , charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included "" providing aid and comfort "" and other services to al qaeda , the fbi said .
he was among the fbi 's "" most wanted terrorists . ""
in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries .
"" your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , "" he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 .
in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called "" a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . ""
he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera .
gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri .
he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks .
"" america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , "" he said .
"" you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card .
so what are you waiting for ? ""
in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , "" the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , "" and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya .
his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab .
he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan .

cnn 's steve almasy contributed to this report .","Adam Gadahn, a U.S. citizen known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, was killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation in January. He was not specifically targeted in the operation, which also resulted in the death of another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative, Ahmed Farouq, as well as two hostages, including U.S. citizen Warren Weinstein. Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American and Abu Suhayb, was born in 1978, converted to Islam at age 17, and moved to Pakistan in 1998. He became al Qaeda's chief English-language propagandist, appearing in videos threatening attacks and urging Muslims to target Western and Jewish interests. Indicted for treason and material support to al Qaeda in 2006, he was on the FBI's most wanted terrorists list. Gadahn appeared in numerous al Qaeda videos, criticizing U.S. presidents and calling for lone-wolf attacks in the U.S. He addressed his Jewish ancestry and renounced his U.S. citizenship on camera. Gadahn was married to an Afghan woman and had at least one child. His last video called for the overthrow of governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and a letter from him with recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy was found among documents recovered after Osama bin Laden's death.",microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B,0.59817,0.35698,0.06687,1,1.0

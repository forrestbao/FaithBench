"""I'm feeling the joints for any kind of heat or swelling."" Veterinary surgeon Dr Sandra Corr puts Daisy the sheep through a very hands-on physical examination. ""I'm looking for any signs of crepitus or lameness,"" she says, ""Anything that might indicate the onset of disease or osteoarthritis."" But Daisy is not just any sheep. She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996. This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters. ""Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,"" he says. We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests. As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation. But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world. According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results. He tells me: ""One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?"" Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some ""age-memory"" might be transferred into the next generation. ""That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,"" says Prof Sinclair. ""A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age."" The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down. But by then Dolly was already suffering from osteoarthritis which, although not unheard of in a sheep of her age, did raise concerns about premature aging. The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more clones. ""We wanted to know if Dolly's untimely death was just unlucky"", recalled Prof Sinclair, ""or if it was something to do with the cloning process itself. If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cloned animals."" Getting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dollies, and nine other sheep cloned from different cell lines, through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-body fMRI scans. Prof Sinclair said: ""We focused on three co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoarthritis - the three co-morbidities most associated with aging. Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-morbidities."" The results of the study, which could have profound implications for the future of cloning, will be published next week. But for now, the dollies, which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays, seem to be in rude health. Follow Tom on Twitter."," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use .
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health .
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men .
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month .
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men .
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men .
opinion : why are more women drinking ?
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study .
"" it 's really , really scary . ""
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level .
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers .
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found .
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent .
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) .
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year .
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol .
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years .
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui .
they think they have control over it . ""
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking .
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute .
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more .
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said .
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said .
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years .

Binge drinking, defined as consuming four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion, increased by 7.5 times among women compared to men over the same period. The study also found that the increases in heavy drinking and binge drinking are driven largely by changes in social norms and cultural attitudes towards alcohol consumption. The study's lead author, Ali Mokdad, noted that women are trying to catch up to men in terms of binge drinking, which is a concerning trend. The study also found that the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time.

"(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for ""Barbara,"" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico.

"(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue."," Sure, I'd be happy to provide a concise summary of the passage!

"(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut.

"(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: ""Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival."" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to ""reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred."" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere.

Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. ""When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,"" Nakatani said. He continued: ""They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth."" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as ""among the most respected men in sports-entertainment"" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks.

He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010.

More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it.

But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning.

Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park.

Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross.

"All glass and concrete beside a fast-flowing stream, the Longford Town Centre was to be a cathedral of commerce - now it stands as a monument to the end of the Celtic Tiger and the Republic of Ireland's economic crash and burn. But local traders believe the bad times are slowly changing. Matt O'Brien runs a family-owned men's clothing shop in the town centre. Recent years have been bad - 30% down on the boom - with a member of staff having to be laid off. But he can now see a turnaround. ""Over the last year we've noticed that business has increased, although it was coming from a low base, but we have improved,"" he says. ""We've done extra things to try to improve things. We've got into childrenswear and we do a very substantial dress-hire business. We've branched out into other areas, which have helped us."" Fianna FÃ¡il, the main opposition party, is highly critical of how the Fine Gael-Labour coalition is dealing with the midlands, arguing that the half-a-billion euro investment in water meters that won't be operational for several years should instead be spent on broadband improvement. Its local TD Robert Troy accuses the government of negligence and says a targeted approach is needed for the area. ""The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) haven't brought one potential client to Longford in over four years,"" he says. ""And if the IDA, which is charged with bringing foreign direct investment to the regions, isn't marketing Longford, isn't showing Longford to potential clients, how then can we expect foreign direct investment to come to Longford?"" But the government says it is doing its bit for County Longford, with the recent announcement that holiday company Center Parcs hopes to employ about 1,000 people at its planned tourism development in Ballymahon in the county when it opens in 2019. However, the proposed 200m euro (Â£146m) centre in 340 acres of wooded area still has to get planning permission. Nevertheless, James Bannon, the local Fine Gael TD, is confident the venture will be a success. He says: ""The midlands has some of the finest scenery and watersports that you could avail of anywhere in the world. ""You have the Shannon, just three miles from here you have the River Inny, you have the Royal Canal, you have huge infrastructure here and we're always open for new tourists to come in to this area."" The Center Parcs announcement will not harm the government's chances in next year's expected general election, but traders like Matt O'Brien believe more could be done to boost local business. ""At the moment a lot of people are unhappy at paying for parking on the street,"" he says. ""Some of our neighbouring towns don't have parking charges. There are issues with the council and if we had free parking it would help bring more people into the town."" So, the message coming from the midlands is that while it, too, is starting to see the beginnings of an economic recovery more still needs to be done."," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:
The Longford Town Centre in Ireland was once intended to be a hub of commerce, but it has been negatively impacted by the country's economic crash and is now a monument to the end of the Celtic Tiger.

However, the government is facing criticism from opposition parties for its handling of the midlands region, particularly in regards to the investment in water meters and the lack of support for local businesses.

"Although there is some common ground between the two governments on, for example, the need for free trade within the single market, Carwyn Jones has complained that he didn't see the letter before it was published on Wednesday. (He has that in common with most of Mrs May's cabinet). The first minister told AMs: ""I discussed the Article 50 letter in general terms with the prime minister when we met in Swansea last week. ""I should be clear, though, that I didn't see the letter before today and we were not invited to contribute to its drafting. This is unacceptable and is the culmination of a deeply frustrating process in which the devolved administrations have persistently been treated with a lack of respect. ""It is all the more regrettable given the UK government's stated aim was to develop a negotiating framework for the whole of the UK."" Mr Jones may have been playing to an audience, but Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns hit back: ""I'm a bit disappointed in that. The prime minister has been in Wales three times in the last six weeks. ""We've been talking about the contents of this letter for many months. ""We've clearly all made our representations but, ultimately, the UK government needs to act in the interests of the whole of the UK and that's what we're doing, specifically with Wales being mentioned."" Mrs May did indeed mention Wales in the letter. She told Donald Tusk: ""When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. ""But it is the expectation of the government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration."" That sentence may have been written more with Scotland in mind, but it does prompt the question: which powers? Farming? Economic aid? And will the money follow the powers? Alun Cairns wouldn't answer those questions, although Carwyn Jones has said he fears there won't be any money to accompany the powers after 2020. (Perhaps Mr Jones doesn't think Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year - Labour has pledged to maintain EU funding levels on regional aid beyond 2020). Some in Whitehall think the way EU money has been spent in Wales - check out Nick Clegg's film from Ebbw Vale - is an argument for transferring those powers to Westminster, but that looks politically less likely now.

"An FBI agent's sniper rifle (similar to the one pictured) was ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot . An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month . Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case.

"Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020. He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."" Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players. ""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said. ""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. ""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said. ""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."" Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. ""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."" UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. ""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders."""," Here is a concise summary of the passage:

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not know the exact reason Alexis Sanchez chose the Emirates Stadium over Anfield - but he is glad the Chile forward will be lining up for his side rather than against them for Liverpool on Saturday. Sanchez had his selection of clubs once Barcelona had decided to let him leave, and following the World Cup, the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under Wenger's expert guidance, going on to make an instant impression in English football. The French coach, however, admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards. Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal . Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (right) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club . 'At the end of the day, only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us. I don't know why he did that, but we are happy that he made that decision,' said Wenger of the £32million Chile forward, who has netted 19 goals so far. 'I was (aware of Liverpool's interest), but you never know if it is really true, but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez (from Barcelona). 'In the negotiations, yes, it is a strength - and it makes sense, an exchange and some money for Liverpool.' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around. 'If you look at the qualities, efficiency, work-rate, fighting spirit - (he is at the) top,' the Arsenal boss added. 'When it (the game) becomes flat, he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters.' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash, Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, who has so far rejected a new contract offer. Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish, Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge. 'He has done very well. I think he found a solution at the right time,' the Arsenal manager said. 'They did well last season too, they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League, which is absolutely fantastic.' Wenger has moved to play down speculation linking him with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling ."," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

Ozil was said to have been spotted in a Berlin nightclub after missing the Gunners' 2-1 win at St James' Park, though manager Arsene Wenger rubbished those claims. He has been doing the business on the pitch after returning from injury though,  wracking up four assists and scoring three goals since January. And the former Schalke man says he is finally adjusting to English football, claiming he fits in 'perfectly'. 'There are a lot of what we call 'English weeks' in Germany - where you play twice, and there's no winter break either,' he said. 'It's demanding because you don't have many breaks to recover, but as a footballer it's great to have so many games and I'm the sort of player who prefers playing in many matches - that's why I fit perfectly here.'

"Barry Pring, 47, was killed by a speeding car as he tried to hail a taxi on the hard shoulder of a dual carriageway in Kiev in 2008. His wife, Ganna Ziuzina, had returned to a restaurant for a missing glove. The coroner at Exeter County Hall, Dr Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. More on the millionaire 'murdered' by his wife, and other news She said: ""His guard was lowered by inebriation. The car had stolen licence plates and did not brake or stop. ""I am satisfied that having heard all the evidence... much of it circumstantial, nevertheless, in my view it is overwhelming. ""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barry John Pring has been unlawfully killed."" She said the case demonstrated the difficulty in investigating a case of a death abroad, adding: ""Our thoughts and condolences must go to the family who have endured years and years of distress and unhappiness."" Close friend Peter Clifford, a lawyer, told the inquest he had ""no reasonable doubt"" that Barry was murdered. Ms Ziuzina, known as Anna, was 19 years younger than her husband. She tried to claim his assets within days of his death. His family believe he was killed in a staged hit and run accident. The couple met online in 2006 and were married in 2007 following a four-day engagement. Mr Pring's mother, Irene Pring, said Ms Ziuzina claimed to be a teacher when the pair first met, but she was in fact a lap dancer and stripper. She said: ""We are sure Anna had some involvement in his death to inherit his money and property. ""I was quite surprised how cold she was with Barry. She did not lift a finger, she was a lazy thing."" The inquest heard Ms Ziuzina sold her husband's Range Rover, contents from his flat and moved funds from his bank account. The hearing was also told she was ""entitled to the first Â£200,000 of his estate"" and that computer records revealed ""she was having an affair with a Ukrainian man"". Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said ""strenuous attempts"" had been made to get her to attend the inquest, but without success. In a statement, Ms Ziuzina said she had made ""three separate statements to Ukrainian police"" and did not believe she could ""add anything further"". Det Con Jonathan Watts, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said Mr Pring was hit by a car with no lights, speeding at 75mph. He also said witnesses at the scene in Kiev described the killing ""as a deliberate act"". The Ukrainian police closed an inquiry into his death, but relaunched it in 2011 as a murder inquiry.

"But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. ""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"". The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. ""I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,"" said Mr Mason."," The passage discusses the use of tablet computers in schools and the findings of a study conducted by Tablets for Schools.

"Carlos Tevez has been told to terminate his contract with Juventus to complete a return to his former club Boca Juniors in Argentina.

"Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch. But that doesn’t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid  a stroke.

The fish begins relaxing in the man's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger . The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man’s fingers.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation. ""After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future. ""We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game.""

"Craig Hughes, 33, of Flint, was arrested by North Wales Police in August after he chatted online with the Hope Line Crisis Centre in Tennessee. Fears were raised over a planned murder bid involving police being ambushed after reports of a non-existent crime. Hughes admitted two charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday. He will be sentenced next week. Hughes said he was planning to make a false report to the police so that officers would come to the scene, prosecutors said while outlining the case earlier in the proceedings. He said he would then shoot them on the Dee Estuary. The threats were made on two occasions, late at night, while Hughes was drunk.

"Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months. It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a ""similar location and mechanism"", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking"", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: ""We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. ""We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. ""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. ""Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site. ""Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles). ""The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism."""," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

""We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast,"" he said. ""The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups."" He added: ""This is a serious business. Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration."" He described as ""absolutely unacceptable"" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters. Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area. ""We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians,"" Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of ""still supporting terrorist elements"" in the country. The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees. But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had ""thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups"".

The Syrian government denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees. The Observatory also reported that fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre said rebels now completely control the prison, which holds at least 3,000 detainees in horrific conditions. Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons, and the US is concerned that the UN-backed plan is falling behind schedule. Russia has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has admitted that the process has been slowed down by security concerns. The Syrian government has stressed that it is committed to all its agreements with the OPCW and the UN Security Council, and will implement its obligations on time.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.96796,0.97075,0.99339,0,1.0

"Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president.

"Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"". ""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. ""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already. ""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. ""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. ""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at."" But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods."" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. ""Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. ""That seems fairer to me,"" he added. The think tank also said the move would be ""extremely popular"" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be ""cleansed"" of ""hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices"". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced ""radical reforms"" to ""get Britain building"" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme ""set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes"". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure ""social housing goes to those in greatest need"", he added."," The passage discusses a report by the think tank Policy Exchange that proposes selling high-value social homes to raise funds for building more affordable housing. The report suggests that selling these homes could raise up to £159bn and build 80,000 to 170,000 new social homes. The proposal has been met with both support and criticism, with some arguing that it could help address the housing crisis and others fearing it could push low-income families out of affluent areas. The passage also mentions that the coalition government has introduced reforms to increase the supply of affordable housing and reduce waiting lists.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park. The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon – rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it. Otherwise, I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment,' argued the Everton manager. Baines (left) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League . 'Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it. I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility.' Barkley's penalty was well-struck but wasn't put in the corner and Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton dived to his right to save.

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series.

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs . Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write. 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all: opportunity.'"," The passage discusses the efforts of Football Association chairman Greg Dyke to push through radical changes in the English football league to increase the number of home-grown players in club squads.

"For many people with severe disabilities, their families and carers, this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house. In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven't got a suitable area to spend a penny. Ordinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet?"" Recommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory. Lorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory ""It's like playing Russian roulette,"" Lorna says. ""Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful. ""My daughter is only six so she doesn't have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through, but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty."" Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people. There are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they? They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet  the needs of people who use them. Mike LeSurf, Changing Places Development Officer at Mencap says: ""There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door, people's needs are not being met."" Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away. ""Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn't a bench and hoist in the toilet,"" she says. ""You just begin to get this sense of feeling like you're last in the line to be considered. ""It's soul-destroying and you don't feel like a valued member of society at all."" But it is not all doom and gloom and Alison gets by with a little help from her friends. She said: ""Freddie went to a party and one of my friends converted a room into a 'pop-up' changing places, and brought stuff from home to kit it out - it was amazing"" Alison even tweeted from the party: ""Friends for life are those who organise parties in the village hall and provide a 'pop up' #changingplace so ALL can go!"" Bethan Folen and her daughter Lowri also enjoy their ""girls' days out"" now there are more convenient and fully accessible places to change nearby. She said: ""Lowri's favourite thing to do is to go to the Millennium Stadium [now known as the Principality Stadium] in Cardiff and watch Wales play rugby. She is a massive fan. Even before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet, says Bethan, ""There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change Lowri"" Changing Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines (BS 8300:2009) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement. Architect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem. ""By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment,"" she says. ""As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this."" For businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans. At 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m). Because of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations. Arsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too. Alun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: ""There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt. ""But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience. ""They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible. ""You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important."""," The passage discusses the lack of suitable toilet facilities for people with severe disabilities, particularly those who require a bench and hoist to change, in public places such as shopping centers, cinemas, and sports stadiums. The article highlights the campaign for Changing Places toilets, which are larger and have additional features such as a bench and hoist, to be made compulsory in newly built larger complexes. The article quotes campaigners and individuals affected by the lack of suitable toilets, emphasizing the psychological impact on families and the importance of accessible facilities for all customers. The passage also mentions the inclusion of Changing Places specifications in the Building Standards guidelines since 2009, but notes that this is currently a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement. The article concludes by highlighting the positive reaction from businesses, such as Arsenal Football Club, that have installed Changing Places toilets, and emphasizes the importance of considering all customers when running a venue.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.94433,0.96455,0.98864,1,1.0

"Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport . A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk. James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight.

"French firm EDF, which is financing most of the £18bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset, approved the funding at a board meeting. Contracts were to be signed on Friday. But Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the government will ""consider carefully"" before backing it. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz has cancelled a trip to Hinkley Point on Friday following Mr Clark's comments. Critics of the plan have warned of environmental damage and potential escalating costs. They are also concerned that the plant is being built by foreign governments. One third of the £18bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors. Hours after EDF's board voted to approve the £18bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project. This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact. EDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished. Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy? Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible. ""We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies,"" he said. ""Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments."" Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was ""yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties"". Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement. Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as ""a unique asset for French and British industries"", saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment. However, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity. Despite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners. Earlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise €4bn (£3.4bn) to help pay for the project. Ahead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was ""very risky"" financially. Earlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself. 5,600 workers on site at peak 4,000km electrical cabling 230,000 tonnes of steel 5.6m cubic metres of earth to be moved Environmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: ""Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money. He added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, ""doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians"". The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind. Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mix Mar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approved Oct 2013 - UK government agrees £92.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the time Oct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn."," The passage provides information on the Hinkley Point power plant project in Somerset, UK, which is being developed by French firm EDF.

When the coalition came to power in 2010 it promised to make unpaid work more physical and intense, with unemployed offenders required to complete their sentences more quickly. The difficulty has always been organisation. Getting people who lead chaotic lives - many of them with drink or drug problems - to work on time is a task in itself. If sanctions are applied, they will end up in prison; if not, the sentence cannot be enforced. As the inspection report reveals, it is a problem the authorities still have not solved. Inspectors did praise instances of high-quality work, and cases where offenders believed they had gained skills from using good tools and equipment. They also highlighted that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and ""were determined to... desist from future offending"". Among its recommendations were that community rehabilitation companies should reduce how often offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time, and to try to create objectives for unpaid work that ""match the circumstances of the offender"". The chief inspector of probation, Paul Wilson, said it appeared in most cases that unpaid work was viewed simply as a punishment, which was a ""wasted opportunity"". ""Although we found some high-quality management and delivery, much of it was simply not good enough, lacking in focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court."" He called for ""urgent remedial action"". A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it wanted ""much more effective rehabilitation"" - which had to start with making sure offenders turned up on time and faced consequences if they did not. ""It's totally unacceptable for offenders to skip work enforced by the courts. ""We accept all the recommendations for the Ministry of Justice in this report and are already taking action to implement them."""," The passage discusses the findings of an inspection by HM Inspectorate of Probation into the delivery of unpaid work as part of community sentences in England and Wales. The inspection found that there were delays in getting offenders to start their work, and that too many were let off if they did not attend. The report highlighted several problems, including a lack of focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court, and a failure to provide offenders with the necessary support and resources to complete their unpaid work. The inspection also found that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and were determined to desist from future offending, but that the lack of effective rehabilitation was a missed opportunity. The report made 15 recommendations for improvement, including reducing the number of times offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time, and creating objectives for unpaid work that match the circumstances of the offender. The Ministry of Justice responded to the report by stating that it wanted much more effective rehabilitation and was already taking action to implement the recommendations.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.97947,0.44631,0.89344,1,1.0

"In his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds. It is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid. Back then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge. They are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four. If they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers. But not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick. Part of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault. Where he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front. Between them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season. With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up. But he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system. Looking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough. It is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team. That means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes. Doing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight. In their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games. They look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault. When I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield. Again, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once. Another problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team. More than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically. Sadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem. Liverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right. From Mamadou Sakho for £18m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for £20m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer. They still look all over the place at the back. Statistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better. Liverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected. What Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there. Simon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box. Rodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea. He was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it. Liverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home. Now he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays. My team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini. For me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu. It is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough. It is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet He was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season. Although he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea. To compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack. Whether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back. That way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks. Going forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed. The trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli. He will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy. Even if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment. Jose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either. The only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric. The Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points. There is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans. Whatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished. He was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future. Playing in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club. The older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one. At 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle. What he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively. Because, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that ""his legs have gone"". Of course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test. What happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside But it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation. As you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone. There is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't. I knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them. What does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself. I knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer. For me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players. Of all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with. He was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen. Saturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside. Of course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him. It would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does. It is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too. Robbie Savage was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan"," In this passage, Robbie Savage discusses Liverpool's current situation and their chances of repeating their title challenge from last season. He highlights several areas where the team is struggling, including their lack of goals, poor defense, and lack of leadership. Savage also criticizes Brendan Rodgers for not addressing these issues in the transfer market, particularly in the striker position. He suggests that Rodgers has not brought in the right players to fit his system and that the team is not starting games with the same intensity as last season. Additionally, Savage notes that Liverpool's defense is still a weakness and that they lack a leader at the back. He also criticizes Simon Mignolet for not coming off his line enough and not commanding his box. Savage predicts that Chelsea will win on Saturday, as they are on a different level to every other Premier League team at the moment. He believes that Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement in order to compete and that their full-backs will need to contribute in the same way as last season in order to succeed. Finally, Savage notes that Steven Gerrard is facing a mental battle to prove that he can still play at a high level and that he will need to work hard to extend his career.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.81284,0.94026,0.97361,1,1.0
"In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the ice fields slipping down Mont Blanc and the surrounding mountains of the European range covered some 375 sq km. By the late 2000s, this area had fallen to about 275 sq km. The research has been presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists. It mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations, but predominantly Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, France, and Italy. The new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gardent, from the University of Savoie, and colleagues. It assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, as well as the famous Mont Blanc Massif in the north. The team drew upon map archives, past satellite imagery and aerial photographs.  Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct. ""We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,"" explained Ms Gardent. ""Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins."" The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km. By 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows. Since then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s. This represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif. ""The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,"" Ms Gardent emphasised. ""We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud."" The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Efforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region. At this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.

"In the year to the end of March, 57 victims of homicide (murders and culpable homicides) were recorded - down five on the previous 12 months.

As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved.

"Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is ""a new low"". Investing Solutions said ""the bulk"" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help ""the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress"". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing ""the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation"". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. ""It's all about the money, it's not about the people,"" he added. ""I thought inspections would be made."" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a ""dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable"". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low."" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords ""who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients"". He also said his company was ""genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property"". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have ""authority from the relevant parties"" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for ""rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing""."," Investing Solutions, a lettings agency, has been found to be profiting from housing benefit payments by finding properties for single homeless men and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property's landlord.

Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign. The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain. This dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June. Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway. However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry. Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it ""must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations"". What complicates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states. The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states. ""A successful industry,"" the report says, ""therefore needs continued market access."" However, that access may come at a price. ""Brexit will involve many trade-offs,"" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee. ""It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs."" The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states. One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away ""raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes"" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. However, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats. Just this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns. Responding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.

"It decided to reorganise the way patients were diagnosed by GPs and specialists by bringing in a new approach, especially to deal with those cancer cases which are not initially obvious. A team of cancer specialists, GPs, NHS and public health experts from Wales have just returned from a fact-finding visit to Aarhus, Denmark's second city. So what was the problem? Prof Frede Olesen of Aarhus University said the changes followed ""quite alarming"" cancer survival statistics more than 15 years ago showing Denmark was performing poorly compared to other European countries, including the rest of Scandinavia. Part of the problem was that waiting times patients faced before getting diagnosed were too long. It was not so much the most serious cases where patients came to the GP with obvious symptoms. They could be fast-tracked to specialists in hospital. It was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out. ""We looked at 30,000 cancer cases - and more than 25% of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn't think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it's important to find those cases,"" said Prof Olesen. What were the changes? The model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes. First -  for patients with "" alarm"" symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast-track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets. In addition to that, by law, any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral. Second, the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs cannot diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them, whether it is cancer or something else. GP Dr Hanne Heje, who works in Aarhus - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer. It also stops the ""ping pong"" between GPs and different specialists. ""Now we know there's a department meeting the patient with open arms saying 'we welcome you', even though there's not a diagnosis written on their forehead,"" she said. The third route deals with the group of patients with minor symptoms, which are very unlikely to be cancer but in rare cases could be. These patients go to so-called ""yes-no"" centres which offer a simple test or scan so they can be seen quickly and any problems identified. ""This can be solved within hours in some cases but 1% will have a serious disease and this can be detected,"" said Prof Olesen. ""For these patients before - they might have had to wait four to six months, so for the small percentage where something is found, they'd start treatment six months behind the time schedule."" The results so far Prof Olesen - a former GP himself - said the changes have not led to a ""flooding of the system"" by more GP referrals but better organisation of how patients are diagnosed within existing resources. Importantly, he says it has also led to better survival rates. ""We've got very optimistic results showing Norway, Sweden and Finland are becoming better year by year,"" he said. ""But very clearly in the data Denmark is becoming better, a faster pace than before and catching up and getting closer to where we should be."" Denmark has a similar health system in how it is funded and organised to Wales. He said there could be lessons shared between Wales and Denmark on how better organisation can help ""in catching up the elite in Europe"". Dr Tom Crosby, medical director of the Wales Cancer Network, said he had been impressed with how the Danish health service had broken down the barriers between GPs and specialists to work better together. He said: ""People are not just doing tests in isolation - they are working together to achieve a diagnosis."""," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

"It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts."""," The passage discusses a study conducted by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law on the factors that contribute to criminal behavior among young people in Edinburgh.

"It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters. It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout."" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and ""fingerprinting"" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named ""Dynamic Mongoose"", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a ""key vulnerability"". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be ""exceptionally worried"" that it is seen as a ""soft touch"", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33."," The passage describes a military exercise called ""Dynamic Mongoose"" in which a German U-boat, U33, is acting as the ""unseen enemy"" in the North Sea, while a Nato fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, search for it.

"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil can now countdown the minutes until the 4pm encounter on Sunday with his brand new Apple Watch. The 26-year-old was the beneficiary of the timepiece - which ranges in price from £299 to £13,500 - as he visited an Apple store on Thursday afternoon.

"Let's not forget the traditional argument with your other half about whose job it was to buy all the batteries for the children's new toys - which are currently a source of tension because nobody can turn them on. Am I right? If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online: Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. ""There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,"" he says. ""The chat room is like the foyer of a church."" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. ""We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,"" says Mr Parker. ""The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity."" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. ""Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,"" he says. ""The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. ""It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world."" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one ""Joseph Carpenter"" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. ""It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,"" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. ""The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago."" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being ""too religious"". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. ""We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,"" says founder Roald Lidal. ""One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,"" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. ""There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga."" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. ""I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,"" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. ""The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly."" ""Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,"" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. ""He was a great communicator."" Sounds like a seal of approval to me."," The passage discusses various ways in which people are using technology to connect with their communities and share the message of Christmas, particularly through online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Some examples include:
* Everyday Church Online, a UK-based virtual church that streams recorded sermons and allows online congregants to chat and interact with each other.
* Guardians of Ancora, a free-to-play fantasy game developed by the Scripture Union, which aims to share Bible stories with children aged 8-11 through a virtual world.
* The Manga Messiah, a comic book version of the nativity story available in 33 languages, including Arabic, which was recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees.
* Social media groups and organizations using platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to connect with their communities and share spiritual messages during the holiday season.

"Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to ""concede everything"", and the opposition's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith, responded that his party was giving people ""false hope"". The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal. But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. ""It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,"" the source said. For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of ""waving through the government's plans"" and ""lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit"". It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing. Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: ""The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on.""

"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. ""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. ""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

"Management body NHS Employers has given the plan the green light after advisers said there were a range of extra tasks they could do with more training. A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs. But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS. It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rotas, while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors. NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-strong workforce could be reshaped to help. The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting. These included: The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages, such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care, with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them. It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff, but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened. Are nurses the new doctors? NHS short of front-line staff, MPs say Report author Candace Imison said there were ""huge opportunities"" in reshaping the workforce, in both improving patient care and providing staff with more rewarding roles. And NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer said: ""Our challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report."" But British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said while he supported increasing the skills of the workforce, this should not be done ""at the expense of good quality training for doctors or indeed doctors themselves"". ""It takes doctors many years to learn how to provide the best care for their patients, and there is no substitute for this kind of expertise and experience,"" he said. ""There should be more staff support for doctors to help them coordinate the best possible care for their patients."" And Unison head of health Christina McAnea said the squeeze on funding in the health service meant there was ""all too often"" no funding for training courses.

"Many women have questioned the safety of the implants, which are used to treat incontinence, after suffering debilitating side effects. Two patients sitting on the original review group quit in protest at what they said was a watered-down report. Now independent expert Alison Britton, a professor of healthcare and medical law, will examine the final report. Ms Robison told Holyrood's public petitions committee that Prof Britton, from Glasgow Caledonian University, would examine the process by which the report came to its conclusions. She told MSPs: ""Professor Britton will produce a report on how the independent review process was undertaken and importantly what lessons can be learned in the future."" The report concluded procedures should not be offered routinely to women with pelvic organ prolapse. It recommended patients  be offered a range of treatments and given the information to make ""informed choices"". The report also said reporting of adverse events should be mandatory. Ms Robison confirmed the recommendations would continue to be implemented despite calls from campaigners for an all-out ban.

I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him.

""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle.

""The public presentation of Suarez as a new Barcelona player will be held on Monday at the Camp Nou."" It is not known if he will play in Monday's game with Mexico's Club Leon. A full explanation of the Cas ruling, which still prevents him from playing ""organised"" matches but now allows him to take part in all ""football-related activities"", will be published at a later date. He will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-match ban in competitive international games, while his competitive Barcelona debut is likely to be at Real Madrid on 26 October in El Clasico. But Suarez will now be available for Uruguay's friendlies against Japan and South Korea in September and Saudi Arabia the following month. Suarez's lawyers argued that world governing body Fifa's decision to suspend him from all football-related activity for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 2014 World Cup group match in Brazil in June was too strong a punishment. Switzerland-based Cas - an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations - said: ""The sanctions imposed on the player by Fifa have been generally confirmed."" But it said preventing Suarez from taking part in any football activity was ""excessive"", as not allowing him to train would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended. World players' union Fifpro said it was ""disappointed that the court had decided not to strongly diminish the sanctions"" and ""remain of the view they are disproportionate in relation to his violation of the Fifa disciplinary code"". It added: ""We regret Cas not deciding to reduce the length of Suarez's bans in exchange for an obligation for him to receive treatment."" In addition to being allowed to train and play in friendlies, the former Liverpool player - who moved to Barcelona last month for £75m - can also attend matches and take part in promotional activities. His legal team said the appeal was a success, arguing Fifa had ""misapplied its own rules when considering the case and the sanction it imposed was disproportionate"". Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: ""Luis Suarez's appeal against a four-month ban has failed. He is though, sensibly I think, now allowed to train with the team."" ""By allowing Suarez to train, Cas appears to have taken into account the club's interests and has emphasised any appropriate sanction for such incidents should be proportionate,"" said Hannah Clipston, a lawyer specialising in resolving disputes. ""What is proportionate for a repeat offender is different to what is proportionate for a first time offender."" Suarez apologised nearly a week after the incident, despite initially claiming to have lost his balance. He was previously suspended for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. In 2011, he was also given an eight-match suspension and fined £40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra."," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:
Luis Suarez, a Uruguayan striker, has been allowed to train and play in friendly matches by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) after appealing against a four-month ban imposed by Fifa for biting an opponent during a World Cup match in Brazil. Cas ruled that Fifa's decision to suspend Suarez from all football-related activity was ""excessive"" and not proportionate to the violation of the Fifa disciplinary code. Suarez's lawyers argued that the ban was too harsh, and Cas agreed, stating that preventing him from training would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended. Suarez can now attend matches and take part in promotional activities, but he will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-match ban in competitive international games.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Emotion. Drama. Excitement. Brilliant football. Noise. Colour. And all this even before Liverpool's Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The Kop in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre. It was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's almost crazed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund, the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel. Liverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe's second-rate pot - not a label anyone was attaching to it after this classic. Liverpool into last four after Euro thriller Istanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp Liverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan When Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October, he revealed one of his priorities was to ""turn doubters into believers"". And it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory, both on the pitch and in the stands. If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened. In nine blistering minutes from the first whistle, this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart, with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration. Liverpool needed three goals, leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005, saying: ""Even if it is not likely it is possible, so we should try."" And yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice, Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes. It was time for believers, time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon. And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touchstone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren. Borussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw-dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up. It takes us back to more words from Klopp. After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early, saying it made him feel alone and adding: ""We decide when it's over."" This was a phrase that could have been stamped on the foreheads of Liverpool's players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do. If anyone entered Anfield as a doubter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left. This night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour, the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The Kop. Before the teams emerged, Anfield was serenaded by arguably the longest version of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" ever heard at the stadium, Gerry Marsden's voice turned off and Liverpool's supporters taking over, the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence. A minute's silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed, Anfield a cauldron of emotions. It was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages, cut to pieces by high-class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere. Slowly, after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit, the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were unnerved to the point where their resolve was broken. Klopp was a man possessed on the touchline, waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players, pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise. It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night. Tuchel said: ""When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change. There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be. Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmospheres ever at a football match."" Klopp added: ""It was brilliant, outstanding, emotional, everything. I will not forget it because it was special. I know this is a place for big football moments. We didn't start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories."" There was certainly a new, unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night. In the afterglow of such sporting brilliance, there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool's performance. It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed. And yet, when there is time for reflection, it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool. Divock Origi's goal, his fourth in his past three games, was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge. Even as Liverpool battled Dortmund's supremacy, Origi showed power, pace and a willingness to fight. Very much the Klopp template, recalling the words of his manager after his first game in charge at Tottenham six months ago: ""We're going to have a lot of fun with this player."" Media playback is not supported on this device Emre Can has had a mixed season but was outstanding before picking up an injury, while Coutinho sprinkles the stardust on this Liverpool team. It seems like splitting hairs after such a glorious spectacle, but Liverpool still have a vulnerability at the back that will surely be addressed by Klopp in the summer. Alberto Moreno is a weak link at left-back and while Sakho may be a popular figure with supporters, talking of ""a win for the Liverpool country"" and taking selfies on the pitch with Origi, close inspection suggests his positional play was something of an adventure for Dortmund's goals. One thing is clear, however, and qualifies as the biggest plus of all - in the space of six months Klopp has imprinted his identity on his new players and Liverpool's fans. The evidence was all over Anfield. Most definitely - indeed many felt the winner of this tie would go on to claim the trophy. It was not a notion welcomed or encouraged by Klopp. Sevilla, winners for the last two seasons, still lurk after beating Athletic Bilbao on penalties while another Spanish side Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up a high-powered last four. But there is almost the spirit of Champions League 2005 about Liverpool's run in the Europa League. Back then Liverpool moved along with no great expectation to not only find themselves in the final but winning it. Klopp will guard against any complacency but the way in which Liverpool pulled off an extraordinary feat on Thursday will give them growing confidence that no task is too onerous for them at Anfield in the semi-finals. The Europa League is not the only prize within reach - a return to the Champions League via victory in this tournament is now tantalisingly coming into view. The famous ""This Is Anfield"" sign has greeted players on the path to the pitch for decades - many touch it for luck and Klopp even did so himself on a visit to the stadium for a friendly when coach of Borussia Dortmund. It carries an aura but Klopp has put a banning order on his players, saying: ""I've told my players you need to win something before you touch the 'This Is Anfield'. It's a sign of respect. You don't do it - it is too big."" Klopp has delivered another incentive to his Liverpool charges."," Here is a concise summary of the passage:

* The match was a thrilling and emotional encounter, with both teams creating chances and playing some excellent football.

The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points.

"Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession.

There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

The company has turned down previous offers of collaboration, but has now given Postmates the green light. The app uses independent contractors who drive their own cars, similar to Uber taxis.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early."," Summary:
On Monday, a group of militants armed with guns and grenades attacked a hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing at least 4 people and wounding over 50. The attackers detonated explosives at the hospital gate before opening fire on staff and patients. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed responsibility for the attack, while the Taliban has denied any involvement. The attack marks a change in tactics for IS, who have previously targeted civilian gatherings and government buildings, but have now adopted a more tactical approach similar to the Taliban by blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. The attack on the hospital has raised concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan, particularly in the capital city of Kabul, where both IS and Taliban militants have been carrying out attacks in recent months.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.25451,0.25151,0.58972,1,1.0

I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional. ""I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required.

"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. ""It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. ""The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). ""John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. ""It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner.

"Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’"," Nathan Hughes, a No 8 for Wasps, had his ban overturned after an appeal was lodged following a red card he received for accidentally knocking out George North.

"No demos on the streets of Athens - even though the Syriza government is poised to agree and implement yet more austerity and liberalisation measures, mandated by creditors and of the ilk that till recently it characterised as hateful. And Greece's resorts are teeming: Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington (home of the IMF). Maybe holidaymakers were hoping to be on the ground for euro break-up history. Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State. But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition? Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â‚¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country. Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year. Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (""there is no alternative""). What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity. Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend. Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me). There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people. So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead. Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half. So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation."," The passage provides information on the current economic situation in Greece and the recent agreement reached by the Syriza government with creditors. Here is a concise summary of the core pieces of information:
* The Syriza government is set to agree and implement more austerity and liberalization measures, as mandated by creditors.
* Greece's resorts are teeming with tourists, with Athens airport expecting 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million.
* The government is not seeing much protest from citizens despite already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, as well as anticipated swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations, and the opening of professions and industries to competition.
* The reason for the lack of protest may be the near-death experience Greece faced in July, which turned Syriza into disciples of the idea that there is no alternative (TINA).
* Despite failing to deliver an end to fiscal austerity, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras remains remarkably popular.
* The new bailout deal will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead, and creditors will need to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half.

In summary, the passage highlights the challenges facing Greece's economy and the recent agreement reached by the Syriza government with creditors.

Bayern managed to book a place in the Champions League semi-finals with goals from Thiago Alcantara, Jerome Boateng, Thomas Muller, Xabi Alonso, and a brace from Robert Lewandowski.

"Presiding officer Tricia Marwick shed tears after veteran Labour MSP Duncan McNeil bid farewell to the parliament.

Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May. Mr Salmond, who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014, used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was ""not divided, but diverse"". He said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added: ""Yes we are a country of different views, but we are not divided. There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland. ""And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that"". He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign.

""There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland. There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country. ""And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now"". Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had ""served the parliament and Scotland with distinction"". The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999. Mr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system. He said: ""It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary. ""We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences."" He recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster.

"Pro-Kremlin party A Just Russia put forward both bills, and linked them directly to the situation in Ukraine. Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev."," Sure, I can provide a concise summary of the passage covering the core pieces of information described. Here is a summary of the main points:
* Pro-Kremlin party A Just Russia has put forward two bills related to the situation in Ukraine, including one that would allow for the annexation of Crimea and another that would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports to Ukrainians.
* The first bill links the situation in Ukraine to the crisis in Crimea, where separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong. Russian MPs say that a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions.
* The second bill would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports to Ukrainians, including allowing them to apply at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August and becoming citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year.

* Several Russian MPs have gone to Crimea, including former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.

"Pte Matthew Boyd, 20, was off-duty on a night out in Brecon when he was punched and beaten by Jake Vallely.

He was loving, caring and loyal. He was always playing jokes on his peers and family, and always brought smiles to our faces."" It said Vallely had created ""a void in our family that will never be filled"", adding the ""unbearable pain"" was something they will have to live with for the rest of their lives. ""During this trial, it has been mentioned that Jake Vallely called himself the 'hardest man in Brecon' on the night that he murdered Matthew,"" the tribute said. ""He couldn't have been more wrong.

"Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. ""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. ""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. ""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. ""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."" His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"". ""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. ""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,"" he says. ""The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards."" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. ""Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. ""But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. ""When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. ""Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. ""The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. ""At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. ""I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. ""He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'"" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the ""Stab in the Back"" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline. ""As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,"" says Mr Smith. ""It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history."""," The passage describes the decline of Fleet Street, a historic street in London that was once the hub of the British newspaper industry. The street was home to many national newspapers, including the Sunday Post, which closed its London office on Friday. The passage highlights the significance of Fleet Street in the past, when it was the primary source of information for the public, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. The article features two reporters, Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith, who have worked on Fleet Street for decades and are now facing redundancy. The passage also includes quotes from former Fleet Street editor Robin Esser, who describes the street as a ""very, very important place"" in the past, and Liz Hodgkinson, who worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and wrote a book about the experience of women working there. The article concludes that the departure of the last two journalists from Fleet Street marks the end of an era, but that it is important to look forward rather than backward.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.82493,0.92687,0.97736,1,1.0
"Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.

Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches.

""School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet."" Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: ""Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged.

""School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.""

"Residents on the east coast of Japan's Hokkaido Island had an unexpected change of scenery this morning after 1,000ft of seabed was forced to the surface overnight. The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby, when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level,  measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight .

"Roma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places. Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack . Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring . Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points . Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in. Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home . Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma, who have fallen off the pace recently . Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th.

"Rome (CNN)Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy .

Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet.""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.""The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"".He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."""," The passage discusses the findings of a review on local tax reform in Scotland, conducted by Prof Kenneth Gibb of the University of Glasgow.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future."," Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing a one-year extension of his term, despite initial plans to leave in 2018. Carney cited personal reasons for the extension, including the need to be present for his daughters' educational milestones. He emphasized that the decision was entirely personal and not influenced by government policy. Carney's extension is seen as a way to provide stability to the economy during the Brexit negotiations, but he made it clear that he will only serve for as long as he can give the role his full attention. The decision was met with no criticism from Prime Minister Theresa May, who was eager for Carney to extend his term.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.91584,0.91926,0.98096,1,1.0

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkBut VR can also be embedded in reality to give people more understanding of the world around them.Increasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists, teachers, healthcare workers and retailers.The BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology.Surveys suggest that while 99% of people have heard of autism, only 16% really understand what it means. In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant.In order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition.The film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around.Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will ""help the public understand a little more about autism"".The film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism.The film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube.Alzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia.A Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition.Virtual meatballsVirtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections.In April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive.Gamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, ""not a typical Ikea customer"" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction.""In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action,"" she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London.""And what they wanted was meatball,"" she said.Meatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants.When meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: ""I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it.""""This is really talking to customers,"" said Ms Franov.Now the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look.Healthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias.Surgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital.Some 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour.Now the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately ""democratise medicine"".Meanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders.In one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation.In September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars.The kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK.Most pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they ""were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me"".Marcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills. The app is currently being trialled at Imperial College, with Mandarin as a pilot language.Users can watch Chinese people having conversations and visit Chinese landmarks such as the Great Wall.Mr Storm is enthusiastic about how VR can transform learning.""We see a future where kids in history lessons are going back to revolutionary France and interacting with the people there,"" he said.It is a view echoed by Nicholas Minter-Green, president of Economist Films.""It is bringing the joy to education. The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool,"" he said.At VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning.""One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required,"" he said.Cash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least."," The passage discusses the increasing use of virtual reality (VR) technology in various fields, including education, healthcare, and retail.

"Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer ""concrete solutions"". ""We want someone who can speak for the royal family,"" he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. ""We welcome it, we are ready for it,"" he said. ""We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary."" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. ""A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people"". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. ""We had an agreement with the crown prince,"" he said. ""The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue."" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was ""hopeful"" that he would ""do more than his predecessor"", Hillary Clinton. ""US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more."" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. ""If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. ""It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. ""So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy."" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for ""peaceful demonstrations"", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. ""It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government."" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. ""These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail."""," Sheikh Ali Salman, the leader of Al-Wefaq, a major opposition group in Bahrain, spoke to the BBC about the current political situation in the country. He emphasized the importance of national dialogue and concrete solutions from the government to address the demands of the opposition. He also highlighted the role of Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa, who is seen as a reformist, in promoting accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman expressed hope that new US Secretary of State John Kerry will be more effective in pressuring the Bahrain government to respect human rights and democratic practices. He criticized the UK government's approach to the crisis, suggesting that they need to speak out more publicly and put pressure on the Bahrain government to end violence and human rights abuses.

"Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites."," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

"Swansea University's Dr Neil Loader and Emeritus Prof Alayne Street-Perrott, are among a team who have found ancient earthworks, possibly 2,000 years old. The discoveries were made in Acre state in the western Brazilian Amazon. Researchers from the universities of Exeter and Reading, and Brazil's SÃ£o Paulo, BelÃ©m are also part of the team. Their research investigated ditched enclosures which were concealed for centuries by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation allowed the discovery of more than 450 large geometrical ""geoglyphs"". The team said the function of these mysterious sites is still little understood. They are unlikely to be villages, since archaeologists have recovered very few artefacts during excavation, and their layout does not suggest they were built for defensive reasons. Instead it is thought they were used only sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America, or Britain's own Stonehenge. Although Dr Loader - who has analysed soil samples from the geoglyphs - said the surroundings in which they were built were very different to other ritual sites around the world. He looked at phytoliths - a type of microscopic plant fossil made of silica - to reconstruct ancient vegetation; charcoal quantities, to assess the amount of ancient forest burning; and carbon stable isotopes, to indicate the type of vegetation growing there in the past. ""The indications are that the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation. So, unlike the towering Maya pyramids of Central America, they were likely not visible above the forest canopy, and this raises questions about their purpose,"" he explained. It had been assumed prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th Century, the Amazonian forests had been pristine ecosystems, free from human influence. But the new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years, which could only have been artificially brought together by humans. It suggested instead of burning large tracts of forest - either for geoglyph construction or agricultural practices - people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms. The team have likened it to a form of ""prehistoric supermarket"" of useful forest products.

"That report was never written, but the murdered opposition politician's colleagues, led by his close associate Ilya Yashin, have since worked to finish it. Most of the Russian-language report, entitled Putin. War, is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine. But its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends. Russia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, arguing that any Russians serving there are ""volunteers"". But Mr Yashin, who presented the report, said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk. ""All the separatists' key successes were secured by Russian army units,"" he said. ""The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory, admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation. There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident."" The dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine. A Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (Â£1,250-1,900) a month. Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles (Â£665m; $1bn): Boris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year, after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation. But those relatives never went public and, after his assassination, have become even more scared. Names and numbers of military units are documented, along with photos of weaponry, although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken. How many Russians are fighting in Ukraine? BBC team attacked while investigating soldiers' deaths Russian families look for soldier sons Mr Yashin said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies. But publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said. And above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia? There are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev. But the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity. In this, they admit he was successful. And it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov. Critics of Mr Putin praised Mr Nemtsov's reports on corruption in the president's entourage and on the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. But they failed to galvanise protests against him."," The passage describes the efforts of opposition politician Ilya Yashin and his colleagues to complete a report on the human and economic cost of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which was started by the murdered opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. The report, entitled ""Putin. War"", is based on facts from Russian and foreign media and aims to accuse President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends. The authors of the report claim that Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive in securing key victories for pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk, and that volunteer soldiers admit to being directed by Russian generals. The report also documents evidence of Russian spending on the conflict, estimated at 53 billion roubles (Â£665m; $1bn).

He said it was one of a series of paintings he has been working on, some of which were ""much bigger"". The relatively small size of Squint (19) - which is about 7ft (2.1m) in height - was one of the reasons Simpson entered it into the competition, though he also admitted that it ""seemed to be a good idea to send one that I was conversant with and was working with"".

"The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja.

It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money.

Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential.

"The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role.

""We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs."" Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: ""I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline.

"The Electoral Commission said 38 MPs had highlighted people, including students, claiming to have voted twice, which is a criminal offence. It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries. Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote. A record number of 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, 500,000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46.4 million figure for the EU referendum. Of these, 68.7% actually voted on the day, the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997. There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline. In total, 2.9 million applications were received over the six-week period. Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10%, including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury, Cambridge, Bristol West and Leeds Central. However, concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year's EU referendum - continue to persist. At the moment, there is no direct link between electoral registers, which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain, and the online registration service now used by a majority of people. The two systems use different databases and cannot communicate directly with each other. Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline, about 4.9 million applications to vote were submitted, the majority of them done online. But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1.4 million, suggesting ""a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates"". With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered, the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30% and 70% in different areas. The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites, including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland. Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May's local council elections, the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed. ""The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service, in comparison to the difficult of contacting a local authority electoral services team by telephone or email to check if they were already registered, meant many people simply submitted another application,"" the report said. Although there was a lack of evidence to back up claims on social media that some people had voted twice, the watchdog said it took the issue very seriously and anyone with information should contact the police. It stressed that although some people - including students and those with second homes - may lawfully be able to register in more than one constituency and cast more than one vote in local elections, voting twice in a general election was an offence punishable by an unlimited fine. The ""dispersed and unconnected"" nature of the 381 electoral registers in Britain means it is not possible to collectively cross-check entries, the watchdog said, and being able to do so would significantly reduce the risk of double voting. It is also calling for people who are registered in two seats to choose in advance which one they will vote in at future general elections. Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement, Cat Smith, said voting twice was a serious offence and police needed to have the resources to prosecute people suspected of doing so. But she warned against a knee-jerk reaction, given the rise in registration and turnout, particularly among younger voters. ""A blanket ban on being registered at two addresses would exclude those who for reasons of work or study need to be registered in two places,"" she said. ""This cannot be an attempt to make it harder for young people and students to register to vote."""," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

"The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community. Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. ""Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,"" he was once quoted as saying. And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts. But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process. After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form. Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science. Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict. As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive. This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted. ""Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,"" he said. During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes. But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough. Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally. He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates. His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work ""any monkey"" could do. The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research. And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis. His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme. Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles. Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure. In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal. But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt. The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins. The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that. ""I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,"" he said of the synthetic microbes. ""If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide."""," Dr. J. Craig Venter is a biologist and entrepreneur who has made significant contributions to the field of genomics. He is known for his efforts in mapping the human genome and creating synthetic life forms. Venter has been criticized for his approach to science, which some see as disregarding conventional scientific practices such as open access to data. Despite this, he has been successful in securing funding and resources for his research through private means.
Some key pieces of information about Dr. Venter and his work include:
* He turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race, which led to criticism from the scientific community.
* He has been working on the creation of a synthetic life form for over a decade and has published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the journal Science.
* Venter's work has focused on the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from the DNA blueprint, rather than the entire genome.
* He formed the J Craig Venter Institute in 2006 to spearhead the labor to create the world's first synthetic life form.
* Venter has also been involved in a genetic treasure hunt aboard his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in the ocean to sequence their genomes and gain a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.
* He believes that synthetic microbes could help wean us off oil and reverse environmental damage by capturing carbon dioxide.

Overall, Dr. Venter's work has had a significant impact on the field of genomics and has opened up new possibilities for the creation of synthetic life forms.

"The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty, a US-based environmental lobby group. Mighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, of turning a blind eye to these practices. Both companies reject the allegations. Singapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash-and-burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia. Indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra, South Sumatra, and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. Singapore-based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99% of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry, it says it accounts for less than 1% of the global market. Mighty's report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires. It also says Olam created a ""secretive market for rogue palm oil companies"" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources. But Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a ""very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning, so it's a 'no burn-no peat-no deforestation' compliance policy"". The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday, having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so. Mr Verghese said he believed the firm's current suppliers all met Olam's strict requirements, but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete. He added that producers who do not comply with the company's sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain. Since Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam, Mighty's allegations could link Singapore's state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven. Temasek's investment in Olam means that ""the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze,"" the report says. Temasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they ""fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same."" The fund told the BBC: ""Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address. ""As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam."" It would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record. It is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations. Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible. Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas. The report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam ""bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations,"" bringing the same practices to Africa ""that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia"". In response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent. ""We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done,"" it said. ""Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain."""," The passage discusses allegations made by Mighty, a US-based environmental lobby group, against Olam International, a Singapore-based agricultural commodities trader, and its main stakeholder, Temasek, the Singapore state-owned investment company. Mighty accuses Olam and Temasek of turning a blind eye to unsustainable palm oil trading practices that contribute to the annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The report claims that Olam sources 99% of its palm oil from third-party suppliers and has a ""very vigorous sourcing policy"" in place, but the company has resisted calls to disclose the names of its suppliers. Mighty alleges that Olam's supply chain may include rogue palm oil producers who engage in illegal and unethical practices, such as burning forests to clear land for plantations. Temasek has dismissed the allegations, stating that it does not direct the business operations of its portfolio companies, including Olam.

"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. ""Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. ""Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. ""There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". ""The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. ""In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews."," Adrian Gill, a well-known columnist and writer for the Sunday Times, has passed away at the age of 67 due to complications from cancer. Gill had been diagnosed with ""the full English"" of cancers, a term he used to describe his own extensive medical condition. Despite his illness, Gill remained stoical and continued to write his column until his death. He was praised by colleagues and peers for his wit, writing ability, and compassion. Gill had a long and distinguished career as a writer, overcoming dyslexia to become a published author. He was known for his controversial and often humorous articles, which often caused debate and discussion. Gill was also known for his personal life, including his marriages to author Cressida Connolly and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, and his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.5227,0.07608,0.00565,1,1.0

"The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday. The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.""

"The exhibition Growing Up in the City at the Museum of Liverpool boasts 25 evocative photographs which capture the life of children over more than 100 years. As well as a providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood, the pictures also provide a thought-provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades. The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets. The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park. The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard. As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work. A nervous looking young maid for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900.

"The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: ""I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves."" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. ""Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,"" said Bennett. ""To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine."" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: ""I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands."" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a ""litany of information"" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were ""several reasons to approve the fight"". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. ""I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,"" said Bennett. ""He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. ""Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. ""Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. ""That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight."" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: ""He's good to go."" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an ""out of control"" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session."," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

"The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000. The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe. In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection. Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus. It can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost. That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes. The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece. The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy. ""Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc. ""Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,"" he told BBC News. Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida. The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the ""revolution"" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan. The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year. Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace. The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight. More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth. There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade. OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage. Equity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a ""truly global company"" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority. ""A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,"" said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger. ""And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries."" One aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions. The fear is that space could eventually become unusable. A recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other. Brian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation. ""We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,"" he told BBC News. ""We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit."" Time will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole. Airbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment. ""Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,” said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.

"The president-elect has said Mrs Trump and Barron will move to Washington ""very soon, after he's finished with school"", but has not put an actual date on the move. But transition spokesman Jason Miller's insistence that the Trumps were ""energised and excited about their new role serving the country"" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media. ""First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world,"" wrote one Twitter user, Pamela Benbow. ""Melania Trump's decision is appalling."" Others joked it was Mrs Trump's taste in interiors which had prompted the decision, while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps' marriage. However, the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising. There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands' years as commander-in-chief: Martha Washington, because it had yet to be built, and Anna Harrison, because her husband died before she could take up residence. But Mrs Trump's decision has its supporters. ""Good, this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron's age,"" one Twitter user noted. However, it is not out of character for Mrs Trump, who has repeatedly stressed that Barron, 10, is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers. But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before? William Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season. The president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time. The first lady referred to the first home as ""Oak View"" but it was more commonly known as ""Red Top"" because of its red roof. But the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House. ""The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not,"" Mr Seale said. ""It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school. I don't find it very surprising."" Mr Seale noted that the children of President John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison's death, were not immediately moved to the White House. James Madison's wife, Dolley Madison, also sent her son from her first marriage, Payne Todd, away to school. There have been two sets of school age children living in the White House in the past three decades: Chelsea Clinton, who was 12 at the time, and Malia and Sasha Obama, who were 10 and seven respectively. They also had to move across the country when their fathers became president - but all three lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from the day of the inauguration. In fact, the Obamas avoided the problem of the girls having to change school mid-term by moving to Washington early, allowing them to start a new school a few weeks before Dad was inaugurated in January 2009. Read more: Why Obama may not go quietly Mrs Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority, with everything else coming second. Reading between the lines, it suggests she will not be taking on the full-time role predecessors like Mrs Obama have. Officially, the role of the first lady is only ceremonial - she is supposed to be the White House's hostess, organising and attending functions with or without their spouses. In more recent times, they have also sought out causes to support and promote. Mrs Obama has used her time backing a number of initiatives and projects, including Let Girls Learn, that aims to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school. The first lady occupies a very public role, according to Mr Seale. ""It gives a kind of personal side to the White House. It might even be considered vital to the public's perception of the president,"" he said. ""[The president] is an administrator and a he is a symbol and I think the first lady's role is very important to that symbol part."" Lou Henry Hoover, wife to President Herbert Hoover, was the first president's wife to really take on an active public role, Mr Seale said. Her immediate successor, Eleanor Roosevelt, also served as a more visible first lady in her husband's administration. One notable first lady who was reluctant to step into the public role was Nancy Reagan, according to Mr Seale. Mrs Reagan, who had a big influence on her husband's presidency and would later become known for her anti-drug campaign, was at first only focused on being a supportive wife. ""Her big interest in the world was her husband,"" Mr Seale said, adding that she was a very private person. As to what Melania's priorities will be there is only one hint - she is interested in tackling cyber-bullying. Read more: Taking to the streets for women's issues It has happened in the past. However, not when the president's wife has still been alive. Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph took the role in 1801, while Angelica van Buren took up the duties of a first lady after marrying President Martin van Buren's son in 1838. Both men had lost their wives almost 20 years earlier. However, could Ivanka Trump - described as her father's ""proxy wife"" by Vanity Fair during the election campaign - take up some of the responsibility from her step-mother? There is more recent precedent, too. Chelsea performed some of her mother's duties during the final days of her father's presidency, while Mrs Clinton concentrated on her own political career. The White House can be whatever the family makes it. Chelsea was known to do her homework in the Oval Office from time to time, while she also hosted sleepovers for friends - which could mean they found themselves sitting with the President the next morning, as Bill Clinton always tried to have breakfast with his daughter. Both Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama fit their duties as First Lady around their children, and both families asked for the press to respect their daughters' privacy - requests which were, on the whole, respected. The Obamas are also strict about putting time aside for the girls: family dinner takes place every night at 18:30. Mr Obama has said only a national emergency will stop him joining his family. ""The surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more 'normal' than it's ever been,"" the President said in an interview with US magazine More earlier this year. It is a response echoed by Chelsea about her own years. She told the Huffington Post: ""I was always deeply aware that I was living in history. But then I would have dinner with my parents at the kitchen table every night.

"The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: ""The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done."""," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests. It contains a large dining room where travellers can enjoy meals cooked in an adjoining kitchen, with a lounge and 'state room' at the back of the plane.

"They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy ""sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment"". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as ""sexier"" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. ""There's a huge market for our timber. Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill,"" he added."," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

"They range from extra responsibility for off-street parking, through to tourism. Potentially, though, the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions. Councils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas. Currently, if you want to build a new house or erect an extension, you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service, an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont's environment department. Planning officials refer your application to your local council. The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application, but the final say rests with the Planning Service. From April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves, meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions. So is this a positive move, democratising our planning system? Michael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE, is optimistic. Mr Corr already works with councils and government departments, providing advice on new developments like leisure centres. He told me the move is ""a huge opportunity for the future, which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans"". But do Northern Ireland's politicians have the necessary skills? Speaking about voters, Mr Corr said: ""They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues, because it's those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference."" However, not everyone is so upbeat. Back in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing. Protests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement. The environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent. James Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: ""In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities."" Mr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a ""tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here"". He said: ""It's quite easy to see that continuing, where we get a laissez-faire system which says, 'you look after your community and we won't bother engaging in proper democratic planning' . That is a real danger and that's why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place."" Friends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties. Some local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security. Others argue that the Â£7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts. Under the terms of a law passed earlier this year, it's up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations."," The passage describes a proposed change in the planning system in Northern Ireland, where local councils will be given more responsibility for making planning decisions. This move is seen as a positive step towards democratizing the planning system, as it allows elected politicians to make decisions rather than unelected planning officials. However, there are concerns about the potential for corruption and unfairness, particularly in relation to the close relationships between developers and political parties. The passage also mentions the importance of transparency in the political donations process, as the public should know who donates to political parties in order to ensure fairness and accountability.

"Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack . Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing . Hull (away) - May 4 . Swansea (home) - May 11 . Man United (away) - May 17 . Sunderland (home) May 20 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry .

"This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box. The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera . The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded . The moment it all started to go wrong: The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip . The unidentified young guard's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away . The guard, wearing full regalia, falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up . 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers. The Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on 'a young man falling over while doing his job'. The embarrassed guard hastily scrambled to his feet following the unfortunate tumble at the palace .

"Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. “Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?” This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began."," The passage describes the launch of the iPhone in 2007 and its impact on the way people lived, worked, and communicated. The author, a journalist, was present at the launch and recounts how he was given the opportunity to hold and film the iPhone for a news segment, despite the product being unavailable for other journalists to handle. The author notes that the iPhone was a transformative technology that put powerful computers in the hands of over two billion people, disrupting various industries. He highlights how the iPhone changed the way people thought about photography and other activities that could now be done on the move. The author also acknowledges that while there were cameras on phones before 2007, the iPhone's user interface made it more accessible to a wider range of people. The passage concludes by expressing gratitude for witnessing a moment in history and recognizing the impact of the iPhone on the mobile connected era.

"Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video . The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer . Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved . This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year.

"Tries from Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van and Chris Bridge gave Widnes a 14-6 half-time lead, with Cas loanee Paddy Flynn responding against his parent club. Flynn scored another early in the second, but Ah Van, Lloyd White (2) and Joe Mellor tries made it 38-12. Despite three Cas tries in four minutes - Larne Patrick, Luke Gale and Flynn's hat-trick score - Widnes held on. The Vikings' victory had looked assured when Mellor took advantage of Castleford indecision on a short kick-off, running straight through to help them to a 26-point lead. But, having lost nine of their previous 10 matches, their defence creaked as they let Patrick, who has just signed a three-year deal to move from Huddersfield after his loan spell, in for a try. Gale and Flynn - on loan at Castleford from the Vikings until the end of the season - made it a nervy finish, but the Tigers suffered their fourth consecutive home league defeat.

"Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year's Nations Cup.

We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco ""We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco,"" said Moroccan FA chief Fouzi Lekjaa. ""We are back after a little break of a few months, but it has not had a big impact. The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass."" Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began. The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead. Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000). Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare. The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over. ""I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,"" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport. Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty. The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared. The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup. Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption. ""We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,"" said Snoussi. ""But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium."" ""But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. ""We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected. ""In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match."" Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement. ""Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,"" said Snoussi. ""We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out."" Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.

"Twice French Open champion Serena Williams said her struggle to beat Sara Errani in the Fed Cup on Sunday had been a real 'eye-opener' as the claycourt season gets into full swing. World No 1 Williams eventually prevailed 4-6 7-6(3) 6-3 against the dogged Italian to take her career record over her to 8-0 but the American was not impressed. The US  were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta, meaning they were relegated to World Group II. American tennis star Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday . Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves . Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1's power proved to be too much . 'Today has been a big eye opener,' Williams said afterwards.

"Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo.

The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday.

""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said.

Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home.

"Women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise - but are less likely to get one, the research found. The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers. It found ""no support"" for the ""reticent female"" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money. For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females. When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found. The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications. The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings. ""The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this."" He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women ""were more straightforward and tell their friends"". ""Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,"" Prof Oswald added. ""It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely."" The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change. Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: ""The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior."""," The passage reports on a study conducted by the Cass Business School, the University of Warwick, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison that investigated the gender pay gap in Australia.

"Yet in this election, it is way down the list of priorities for most political parties. Philip Hammond, himself a former defence secretary, has been reported as saying recently that ""there are no votes in defence"". He does not recognise the quote, but the sentiment is largely borne out by the opinion polls which show defence just scrapes into the top 10 of electorate concerns, way behind the economy, the NHS and immigration. UK military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya may have also contributed to a sense of combat fatigue among the public and a reticence by politicians to focus on the subject. James de Waal, a senior fellow at independent think tank Chatham House, says in this campaign, politicians have been ""on the defensive on defence"". This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK’s defence forces at home and abroad. Policy guide: Where the parties stand To find out Labour and Conservative policies on the subject you will have to persevere to page 77 of both their manifestos. Even then they are pretty short on detail and do not really address the difficult decisions the next government is likely to face. So to help, here is a guide to some of the more sensitive issues being left out. Most analysts, and politicians, agree the world is becoming more dangerous and unstable, whether that is shown by thousands of migrants fleeing so-called failed states, the threat from Islamic extremism, or a more belligerent Russia. Yet at the same time, most European nations, including the UK, have been making significant cuts to their armed forces. The size of the UK's regular Army is being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000. You could fit that number in Wembley Stadium and still have seats to spare. The Royal Navy now has a fleet of just 19 warships, while the RAF has been left with eight - soon to be seven - front-line fast jet squadrons. There are some things the UK military can no longer do - so-called capability gaps. The UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft. It has to rely on its Nato allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters. At the start of the last parliament, David Cameron could boast that the UK was the fourth biggest spender on defence in the world. Now, according to the Stockholm International Research Institute, the UK has fallen to sixth place, behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and France. A commitment to spend 2% of the nation's wealth, or GDP, on defence is conspicuous by its absence. Only two smaller parties - UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party - say they would continue to meet that goal. But all the indications suggest the UK will soon fall below the Nato threshold. Malcolm Chalmers, of the defence think tank Royal United Services Institute, says on current projections, UK defence spending will fall to 1.7% by the end of the decade. If there are more cuts it could fall to 1.5%. He calculates that defence would require another £25bn over the next five years to stay above 2%. The military top brass know that is not going to happen. Their planning assumptions are based on flat spending plus an annual increase of 1% in the equipment budget. Spending 2% is not mandatory to Nato membership. Few states do, but it is totemic. The US will inevitably think less of a key ally that no longer lives up to that commitment, especially when David Cameron recently lectured others on the need to increase defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales. In US eyes, the UK's credibility will inevitably suffer if, as seems likely, it fails to meet the 2% target. It is more than likely that any future government will have to make more cuts in defence. The question is by how much? Over the lifetime of the last parliament, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) cut its budget by about 8%. With the Conservatives, Labour, and the Lib Dems promising to bring down the budget deficit, there will have to be more savings in public spending. None of these three parties say they would ring-fence or protect defence, like the NHS or overseas aid. The MoD has reason to be nervous - it has the second largest non-protected budget, after welfare, of £34bn a year. Another Conservative-led government plans to make savings of around £12bn a year. Shared across the board that could mean the MoD losing at least another  £2bn-£3bn of its annual budget. But Michael Clark, director of defence think tank Rusi, says most of the political parties appear to be backing away from further big cuts, in part because UKIP has made defence an issue during the campaign. The Conservatives also appear to have limited their options. They are promising to replace Trident, to increase the defence equipment budget by 1% a year, and to make no further cuts to the size of the regular army. Mr Clark says those commitments will make it hard to find ""significant savings"" in defence. But without raiding the MoD's coffers, he says, the Conservatives' entire fiscal plans would ""go out of the window"". Labour has been careful to avoid making similar commitments. Military chiefs, though, are still worried. Gen Sir Richard Shirreff, who was the second most senior military commander at Nato, says: "" I fear it's almost certain that there will be more cuts."" The Conservatives and UKIP are committed to renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent with a like-for-like replacement. That means building four new submarines at an estimated cost of at least £20bn. According to the MoD's own figures, about one quarter of committed defence equipment spending over the next decade will be on the successor submarines and deterrent systems. So it is an obvious area to look for savings. Labour say they would continue the round-the-clock patrols, known as Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), but will look at whether that can be done with three rather than four submarines. The Liberal Democrats say they would retain a nuclear deterrent, but end CASD - what has been dubbed a ""part-time deterrent"". The SNP and the Greens would scrap it altogether. There is no political consensus. James de Waal, who worked in the MoD on the last Strategic Defence Review says: ""Trident might be up for grabs."" It is worth remembering the Tories went into the last election committed to renewing Trident, but as part of the coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats, postponed the decision. What is to prevent another review and another delay, especially if a party like the SNP holds the balance of power? Paul Ingram, who heads the British American Security Information Council, says the nuclear programme will have to be included in the next Strategic Defence Review, due after the election. Not least because he says the US will find it hard to stomach a key ally spending all that money on the nuclear programme, if it means contemplating further cuts to the UK's conventional forces. By the end of this decade, after a gap of 10 years, the UK will have two new operational aircraft carriers. The Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. They should be a symbol of power and of global ambition. But there is a danger that they will be more like the emperor's new clothes. On current manning levels, the Royal Navy will struggle to crew both carriers, even if as planned only one of them is operational at any given time. Plans to equip them with the new F-35 jet, have already had to be scaled down. There is space on board for 36 F-35s, but current plans are to sail with just 12. The current chief of the defence staff, Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton, has already warned of the dangers of a ""hollow force"" with ""exquisite equipment"" but not enough people. Politicians have long boasted that in military terms Britain can punch above its weight on the world stage. But it's becoming harder to live up to that rhetoric."," The passage provides information on the UK's defense policies and spending, as well as the challenges faced by the military. Here are the core pieces of information summarized:
1. Defense is not a priority for most political parties in the current election, with few providing detailed policies on the subject.
2. The UK's defense spending has been cut significantly in recent years, and the country is likely to fall below the NATO threshold of spending 2% of GDP on defense.
3. The Conservative and UKIP parties have committed to spending 2% of GDP on defense, but other parties have not made similar commitments.
4. The UK's nuclear deterrent is an area of contention, with different parties having varying views on its replacement.
5. The Royal Navy is facing manning issues and will struggle to crew its two new aircraft carriers, even if only one is operational at a time.
6. The UK's military is facing a ""hollow force"" problem, with ""exquisite equipment"" but not enough people to operate it.

Overall, the passage suggests that the UK's defense policies and spending are under scrutiny, and the country may face challenges in maintaining its global ambition and military capabilities in the face of budget cuts and manning issues.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.85181,0.44366,0.92988,1,1.0

'i’ve never been so happy in all my life , ' she wrote for xojane . 'i’ve had this stupid grin on my face for a week straight .

' i really think we - and by `` we '' i mean nice people and body-positivity - are winning , ' she said ."," In her TED Talk, burlesque performer Lillian Bustle challenges the negative connotations surrounding the word ""fat"" by embracing it as an honest self-descriptor. She notes that society has programmed women to avoid using the word ""fat,"" but she believes that it's important to reclaim it and recognize that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. Lillian shares her personal experience of feeling insecure about her body, particularly her arms, before her first burlesque performance. However, once she began performing, she felt empowered and body-positive. She encourages others to find their own ""courage reference"" – a moment when they felt brave – to help them overcome insecurities and embrace their bodies. Lillian also highlights the importance of exposure to body diversity, citing studies that show that the more people are exposed to different body types, the more they tolerate and accept them. She hopes to contribute to this shift through her burlesque performances, which showcase a fuller figure in a positive and glamorous way. While some viewers have left negative comments on the video, the majority of responses have been positive, with many people expressing gratitude for Lillian's message and sharing their own personal stories of body positivity.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.86211,0.97395,0.99344,1,1.0

"a mother of a baby boy was arrested 27 years after his body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a sainsbury 's bag floating on a village pond .
police exhumed the boy 's body from his grave in norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review .
a dna sample eventually led them to his mother .
the woman , who has not been named , was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends .
she explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of weasenham st peter on june 5 , 1988 , just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a sunday afternoon outing .
unsolved case : a police officer searches windmill pit , the norfolk pond where the baby boy 's body was found back in 1988
the boy 's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review , with dna samples leading police to the boy 's mother .
he has now been reburied at weasenham st peter church , norfolk
police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the cps decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial .
during the original investigation , police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby 's burial at 13th century st peter 's church in the village .
a report in the eastern daily press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond
but after the body was exhumed in april last year , dna taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents .
detectives examined that person 's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy 's mother .
a police spokesman said : ` in this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation .
` thanks to advances in dna we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself .
` sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play . '
det insp andy guy , of norfolk police who led the investigation said the dna was compared to five million samples on the national database .
he said : ` it came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age .
` we went to see that individual and she told us she was mum .
she was arrested on suspicion of infanticide .
` we were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her .
` the pregnancy was concealed from everybody .
she did n't tell her family , her close friends , she gave birth in secret .
the baby was stillborn . '
the woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond , known locally as windmill pit , before it was found by a group of teenagers .
the boy was originally buried without a name but a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as peter after the name of the church

sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article ."," A mother of a baby boy who was found dead in a Sainsbury's bag floating on a village pond in Norfolk, England, was arrested 27 years after the discovery. The police exhumed the boy's body from his grave in Norfolk last year and a DNA sample led them to the mother. The woman, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained that the baby had been stillborn and she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends. She revealed that she had placed the dead baby in the pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter on June 5, 1988, just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a Sunday afternoon outing. The baby's body was reburied at Weasenham St Peter Church, Norfolk, after a second post-mortem found no evidence of foul play. The police have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the CPS decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial. The case was unsolved for 27 years, but advances in DNA technology allowed the police to trace the mother and solve the mystery.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.28163,0.93205,0.99145,1,1.0

a northumbria police spokesman said the funds would be allocated ` in the same manner that victim support were directly funded by the moj ' .
but critics have described her selection of charity as ` inappropriate ' and a conflict of interest .

mr young , a former soldier , had mistakenly believed mr hicks was planning to ` do a runner ' and decided to drive him back to the rank in a bid to teach him a lesson .
but when mr hicks objected , the driver continued on for almost a mile , leading him to jump from the vehicle while it was travelling at more than 20mph .
he suffered devastating brain injuries , developed epilepsy and now requires round-the-clock care from his mother .
mr hicks ' family , from bath , took driver mr young to the high court ( pictured ) , where a judge ruled he had unlawfully imprisoned his passenger
mr hicks ' family , from bath , took mr young to the high court .
there , mr justice edis ruled the driver had unlawfully imprisoned mr hicks , who was therefore entitled to damages .
the exact amount of compensation is yet to be decided - but is set to be around 50 per cent of what the family had requested and thought to be ` hundreds of thousands of pounds ' .
speaking on behalf of the family , lawyer james davies said : ` this was a terrible incident in which kristopher suffered a very severe brain injury leaving him needing care for the rest of his life .
` the latest judgement agrees that kristopher is entitled to a settlement to provide specialist rehabilitation and care which will help maximise his progress . '
mr hicks , who was 23 at the time of the incident , had gotten into the taxi with his girlfriend abigail noad at orange grove taxi rank in bath to his home in the foxhill area , according to high court documents .
in a police interview , mr young said he had become suspicious after hearing ms noad joke that the couple were not going to ` do a runner ' .
deciding the issue of liability , the judge said mr young mistakenly decided mr hicks was not going to pay the fare on november 2 in 2010 , adding there was no basis for him to think so .
the driver had decided to take mr hicks back to the rank to cause him as much inconvenience as possible .
mr hicks , who found himself being unlawfully driven off by a stranger into the night , decided he should try to escape .
mr justice edis said : ` the end result is that the claimant decided to jump out of the taxi at a dangerous speed .
i do not know why he did this .
` it may have been that he misjudged the speed and thought it was safe to do so , but the true motive will never be known . '
he said had mr hicks jumped out when it was stationary at lights there would be no permanent damage .
mr hicks had gotten into the taxi at the orange grove rank in bath ( pictured ) in 2010 with his girlfriend
` i have broadly accepted the evidence of the defendant and therefore find that his intention was not to do anything other than to return him to the rank where he would be released , ' he added .
` this is the kind of conduct which creates a significant risk to life and limb as this case demonstrates . '
the judge said it was a ` stark and unattractive choice ' to decide between the two - and concluded there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the damages payable to mr hicks .
he was also entitled to a further £ 250 for unlawful imprisonment .
lawyers representing mr hicks said the incident left him with ` devastating ' brain injuries and he is now being cared for by his mother gill .
speaking at the time the claim was lodged with the high court , james davies , said : ` whilst he has undergone extensive treatment and rehabilitation , he has developed post-traumatic epilepsy , headaches , fatigue , suffers social and behavioural problems and has no sense of taste or smell .
` he is reliant on 24-hour care from his mum and is unable to work . '
both sides were given permission to appeal and a further hearing will determine the amount which mr young will have to pay ."," A taxi driver in the UK has been ordered to pay compensation to a passenger who suffered severe brain injuries after jumping out of the moving taxi.

the entrance to the flats in one of the most expensive areas to live in britain where a three-bedroom apartment has been put on the market for just £ 575,000
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the property could be worth upwards of £ 6 million .
the ` unmodernised ' maisonette in the in exclusive egerton place , is described as ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space .
it boasts three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a reception room and utility room along with a lift , parking and a communal garden .
the property is being sold by russell simpson for £ 575,000 - the same price as a three-bedroom house in stanmore , middlesex .
it is one of two maisonettes being sold with three years remaining on the lease .
both homes will need to be modernised , with the second , larger property - also on egerton place - on the market for £ 595,000 .
the next cheapest three-bedroom property in knightsbridge costs £ 1.5 million , and this flat is only offered with a 28-year lease .
but the property comes with a catch , not only is it in dire need of renovation , ( such as in one of its bedrooms , pictured ) the home has just three years left on the lease
the cost for £ 575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area , plus renovation works which are needed , such as in the living room ( pictured )
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space , could be worth upwards of £ 6 million
jake russell , from russell simpson , said : ` properties like this come up once in a blue moon and i think it is an outstanding opportunity .
` to get properties like this in egerton place is very exciting and the phone has n't stopped ringing , which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner .
` we have had interest from locals , developers and end users .
in modernised condition , we would estimate they would sell for between £ 2,750 and £ 3,000 per sq/ft . '
this gives the smaller property a £ 6 million prices tag , while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £ 7.5 million .
the current freeholder is thought to be the welcome trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and , for a 90-year lease , it is likely to cost between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million .
egerton place was built off michael 's grove by john grover and son to the designs of architect mervyn macartney around 1893 .
the properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the egerton gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets , finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange .
estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone ` has n't stopped ringing ' about the egerton place apartment
but alex newall , from hanover private office , had a warning to potential buyers : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease '
leases of all the homes were granted by the smith 's charity trustees in 1894 , and its first occupant was , sir evan macgregor , permanent secretary to the admiralty .
other residents of high status included the dowager lady lawrence , probably the widow of the first baron lawrence , at no. 5 , and sir henry fielding dickens , q.c. , son of the novelist charles at no. 2 .
one property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases .
alex newall , from hanover private office , said : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease .
` a developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder .
` it is a very quirky situation .
properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like knightsbridge .
` i know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought ` right , i need to extend it ' , but by then it was too late and the extension was too much .
` let it be a warning to check your lease . '"," A three-bedroom apartment in one of the most expensive areas of Britain, Knightsbridge, has been put on the market for £575,000.

jackson and chandler , both of south east london , were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of grosvenor casinos , two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in january last year , and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison .
the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .

his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 54 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .

the trial had heard how mr hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as rachel , even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him .
granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two
after their first date , granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that hassan was ` flashy ' and saying : ` this guy is a professional gambler .
he has never worked a day in his life . '
on the night of the murder , mr hassan had taken granger to the top mayfair restaurant nobu before going on to the palm beach casino nearby , where he gave her £ 1,000 in cash to gamble with .
dressed in a strapless top , tight-fitting black trousers , high heels and a large gold necklace , granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing mr hassan ` passionately ' and she told the pair to ` get a room ' .
later , he took her back to his islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend jackson and his friend chandler , who were poised to strike outside .
using parcel tape , the two men tied up mr hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash .
while mr hassan 's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered , the killers were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing wads of £ 50 notes around .
they fled with £ 3,000 , his tv and mobile phone , but were caught after granger 's phone records were examined .
granger 's co-defendants kyrron jackson , 28 , ( left ) and nicholas chandler , 29 , ( right ) , both from south east london , have both been convicted of murdering mr hassan and are to be sentenced in due course
granger ( left ) helped kyrron jackson ( centre ) and nicholas chandler ( right ) rob and kill gambler mr hassan
police found mr hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm .
his knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek .
investigators found he had suffered a ` vicious and sustained attack ' -- probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money .
granger 's ` soft target ' was known to have two favourite casinos in mayfair - the playboy casino on old park lane and the palm beach casino in berkeley street .
he sometimes won as much as £ 15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts , he would keep his winnings around his flat , even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave .
the fact the divorced father ` enjoyed the company of women ' made him particularly ` vulnerable to the unscrupulous ' , prosecutor crispin aylett qc told jurors .
chandler is pictured throwing around £ 63 notes around which he stole from mr hassan after killing him
he said mr hassan 's death was the ` culmination of the ruthless greed ' of jackson and chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in south kensington in january and february last year , but with limited success .
the jury was shown cctv film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of granger and mr hassan together in the casino hours before the killing .
they were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim 's money around hours after the murder , with jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants .
speaking after their convictions last week , mr hassan 's family said his death will ` haunt them forever ' .
his daughter stephanie hassan added : ` every day we miss him and we love him .

Granger and her co-defendants, Kyrron Jackson and Nicholas Chandler, were found guilty of robbing and killing Hassan, as well as conspiracy to falsely imprison him.

"breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic ` markers '
breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic ` markers ' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness .
after surgery , the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened , and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning .
for some women , the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent , which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy .
the majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence .
although the medication kills off cancer cells , the side effects -- including complete hair loss , nausea , sickness , weight gain or loss , and extreme fatigue -- can be difficult to live with .
for some women , the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself .
but experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others , and that for some , chemotherapy may not be necessary .
if the newest of the tests , called endopredict , shows a low score , patients can opt not to have chemotherapy .
most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £ 2,500 , although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the nhs .
surgeon hemant singhal said : ` i think there is a good case for the nhs to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy . '
professor kefah mokbel , consultant breast surgeon at st george 's hospital , london , said : ` with this test we can help patients make an informed choice , whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone . '
becca cornford , a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11 , six and four , was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast .
the majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence
she said : ` i dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy .
i was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children . '
professor mokbel operated on becca in december at the princess grace hospital , london , and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the endopredict .
a low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds .
` i could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return , ' she says .
` there is no treatment that places your chances at zero .
but if you have regular monitoring , there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early . '"," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:
The new tests can determine the genetic markers in a breast cancer tumor and determine its aggressiveness, allowing doctors to spare some patients from chemotherapy.

"carriers of the brca1 gene , like hollywood star angelina jolie , can reduce their risk of death once they have been diagnosed with breast cancer by having their ovaries removed
women diagnosed with breast cancer caused by the gene carried by angelina jolie could be helped to beat the disease if they have their ovaries removed as she did .
a study indicates that following the example of the hollywood star cuts their risk of dying from breast cancer by more than 60 per cent .
miss jolie , 39 , had the procedure , known as an oophorectomy , in march .
two years before , she had a double mastectomy as she carries the brca1 gene variant which dramatically raises the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer .
women who carry a mutated version of brca1 or another gene known as brca2 face a life-time risk of breast cancer of up to 70 per cent .
if diagnosed , they face a severe threat of ovarian tumours .
the researchers in canada analysed 676 breast cancer patients who had one of the mutated genes , nearly half ( 345 ) underwent oophorectomy after their diagnosis .
the study found the 20-year survival rate for the entire group was 77.4 per cent .
having an oophorectomy was associated with a significant drop of 62 per cent in breast cancer death in women with a brca1 mutation , but this did not occur in those with a brca2 mutation .
there were nine deaths from ovarian cancer in the women who did not have oophorectomies .
the scientists found a 65 per cent reduction in death from all causes associated with oophorectomy .
according to the study , oophorectomies were performed an average of six years after breast cancer diagnosis .
for the 70 brca1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years , there was a 73 per cent reduction in death compared with women with the mutation who never underwent the procedure .
the authors , writing in the journal jama oncology , said that the protective effect of oophorectomy against breast cancer was apparent immediately after diagnosis and lasted for 15 years .
dr steven narod , of the women 's college research institute , toronto , called for follow-up studies on women who undergo oophorectomy as part of their initial treatment , in particular , those who had the surgery within a year of finding out they have breast cancer .
he added that more research was needed , especially on carriers of the brca2 variant .
journal editor dr mary disis said the results were ` compelling and suggest the potential of oophorectomy should become part of the treatment discussion at the time of diagnosis for brca mutation carriers with early stage breast cancers ' .
she added : ` the results provide a validation of oophorectomy in coveying both a disease-free and overall survival benefit for brca1 carriers .
` in the entire group , oophorectomy was particularly effective for survival benefit in women with oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer . '
those women diagnosed with the brca1 gene mutation have a 50 to 80 per cent risk of developing breast cancer , pictured , in their lifetime
women with a significant family history of breast cancer may have an increased risk of getting the disease .
a significant family history is defined by :
women who inherit the faulty , or mutated , brca1 or brca2 genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime .
genetic tests are available to women who are likely to have a brca1 or brca2 mutation , or faults in two other genes called tp53 and pten .
brca gene faults are more common in the ashkenazi jewish population , about 2.3 per cent of ashkenazi jewish women have a brca gene mutation .
this type of the disease affects about one in four women diagnosed with breast cancer .
it is an especially aggressive form which is often resilient to drug treatment and requires intensive chemotherapy .
other studies of the gene mutation carriers have found that reduced mortality is associated with ovary removal for women with a history of breast cancer .
speaking about her decision to have the procedure miss jolie , who has six children , said that having her ovaries removed did not make her feel any less womanly .
in an article for the new york times , she wrote : ` i feel feminine , and grounded in the choices i am making for myself and my family . '"," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:
Angelina Jolie, a carrier of the BRCA1 gene, underwent an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) after being diagnosed with breast cancer. A study analyzing 676 breast cancer patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation found that those who had an oophorectomy after diagnosis had a 62% reduction in breast cancer death and a 65% reduction in death from all causes, compared to those who did not have the procedure. The study also found that oophorectomy was particularly effective for survival benefit in women with oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Genetic tests are available for women who are likely to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, and Ashkenazi Jewish women have a higher prevalence of these mutations. Removing the ovaries can reduce mortality in women with a history of breast cancer, and Angelina Jolie's decision to have the procedure did not make her feel any less womanly.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.86667,0.94126,0.97659,1,1.0

just over a quarter of women giving birth in england now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s .
this includes a growing number of women opting to have planned caesareans because they are very anxious about giving birth naturally .
but last night experts from the world health organisation , the un 's public health agency , said this figure should ideally be between just 10 per cent and 15 per cent , due to the dangers and costs involved .
in a statement , they said : ` although it can save lives , caesarean section is often performed without medical need , putting women and their babies at risk of short - and long-term health problems . '
they added that the procedure can lead to ` significant complications , disability or death ' and diverts precious money away from the needs of other patients .
a planned caesarean costs the nhs an average of £ 2,369 , compared to a natural birth at £ 1,665 .
the who statement sharply contradicts current nhs guidelines , which say the procedure should be offered to women even when there is no medical justification .
the watchdog nice issued revised recommendations in 2011 allowing women to have the operation if they were very anxious about childbirth , a condition known as tokophobia .

"four royal navy sailors charged with the gang rape of a young woman at an alcohol-fuelled party at a canadian barracks must stay in nova scotia until they have been tried .
the four men appeared in turn in a courtroom in dartmouth , near halifax , where they were given identical but unusual bail conditions that could see them having to live on a canadian naval base for the next few years .
bail was set at over £ 2,000 for each of them but they also agreed to surrender their passports and live at the nearby stadacona naval base in halifax .
accused : joshua finbow , 23 , a submarine engineer from stockbridge , hampshire , arrives at court today
two of the accused , simon radford , 31 , of gosport , hampshire and craig stoner , 24 , from stonehouse , gloucestershire hid their faces as they were led to a provincial court in dartmouth , nova scotia
darren smalley , 35 , of gosport , hampshire , and his co-accused were ordered to surrender their passports as part of their bail conditions
in a deal agreed with the british government , they will also continue to work for the royal navy and draw their current pay .
it was not clear last night how they will keep themselves occupied thousands of miles from their shipmates and a representative from the british high commission who was in court refused to elaborate .
the four -- joshua finbow , 23 , a submarine engineer , craig stoner , 24 , simon radford , 31 , and darren smalley , 35 -- had been playing for the royal navy ice hockey team in a tournament at the shearwater naval base just east of halifax .
the alleged sexual assault , in which police sources say all four men had sexual intercourse with their victim , took place on april 10 after the sailors had returned to the barracks from a hockey game .
sources say their victim , who is aged in her early 20s and lives in halifax , had accompanied a friend who had been invited to attend the party by local canadian servicemen .
yesterday , all four men -- three of them wearing black royal navy ice hockey team hoodies -- looked relieved to be getting out of custody as they respectfully answered judge john macdougall 's questions .
charged : royal navy sailors joshua finbow , 23 , ( left ) and simon radford , 31 , ( right ) appeared in court
held : craig stoner , 24 , ( left ) and darren smalley , 35 , ( right ) are being held by military police in canada
they all said they understood their bail conditions and crown prosecutor eric taylor said outside court that the accused had not asked to be returned to the uk .
they were ordered to return to court on may 27 and given the names of seven people -- the victim and six witnesses -- who they were forbidden to contact .
they must not leave the province of nova scotia and can not apply for new passports .
they must remain employed by the navy and must not resign without the court 's permission .
the four , no longer trying to hide their faces , later filed out of the court building and were driven away together in a large white suv to their new home on the close stadacona base .
they ignored a question over how they might plead in the case .
commander michael o'sullivan , the air and naval advisor at the british high commission , has spoken to the four and described the alleged offences as ` serious ' but stressed they were as yet only allegations .
naval base : the east coast navy base at halifax , nova scotia , near to where the alleged incident occurred
military base : an aerial view of the shearwater military base where four british sailors are accused of assaulting a civilian
the commander , who drove the car the men left the court in , added : ` we 're assisting the canadian authorities with their investigation . '
the four are charged with sexual assault causing bodily harm and group sexual assault -- offences that are punishable by up to 14 years in prison .
crown prosecutor eric taylor said the investigation was still at an early stage and the results of forensic tests could result in additional charges .
` it will be up to the royal navy to decide now how to employ them while their charges are working their way through the court , ' he said .
canadian military investigators have described the alleged offences as ` a disturbing accusation of sexual assault ' .

' he said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people , including lawmakers , uncomfortable . but he thinks the exchange program should n't be viewed as anti-drug policy , but as ' a proven and effective harm-reduction policy . ' ' we simply ca n't afford to view this as a short-term problem , ' clere said . money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options . since 1989 , the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs . pence 's executive order did n't include money for the scott county program .

factors behind the decline vary from shops now opening on a sunday and more live football on tv , meaning more people put off the chore at the weekend .
the rise of hand car washes has been blamed for a decrease in drivers washing their own cars ( file pic )
other reasons given for not washing cars include the rise of hand car washes and the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean .

The art of washing one's own car is dying out in Britain, with a third of men admitting they have never done it and only 12% of those who do wash their own car doing it regularly. According to a survey of 1,100 adults by vehicle leasing firm OSV, factors contributing to the decline include the rise of hand car washes, the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean, and the increasing availability of automated car washes. The survey also found that Brits are more likely to wash their own cars during holidays, with an estimated 15 million cars cleaned by their owners during the recent Easter break. However, one in four people admitted to only washing their car as an excuse to get out of the house. The most likely cars to be washed by their owners are Audi, Toyota, and BMW, while the least likely are Range Rover, Peugeot, and Mercedes. OSV spokesperson Andrew Kirkley noted that while washing one's own car was once a national tradition, the decline is likely due to a lack of time, the size of modern cars, and the availability of alternative car washing options.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,0.95095,0.95911,0.97927,0,0.0

Open Garden has developed a small device called Greenstone that enhances the functionality of its Firechat app. Greenstone acts as a beacon or booster for off-the-grid networks, making it easier for messages to move around in wireless mesh networks. Firechat was launched last year and has been downloaded over five million times, taking advantage of Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF) in iOS 7. MCF allows messages and photos to be sent even without a mobile or data signal by creating a localized network of phones that act as nodes. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way, and Greenstone aims to solve this problem.

"just 13 and in the grip of a terrifying obsession surviving on just one piece of fruit a day , anorexic schoolgirl laura scurr 's body started to shut down .
the 15-year-old , from whitley bay , was left on a heart machine after she collapsed through starvation but has now spoken about pressures put on teenagers to be a ` size zero ' .
laura became so obsessed with having the perfect figure she would hide food down the side of her bed , lying to her mother about eating and sometimes surviving on just a piece of fruit a day .
laura scurr , 15 , has spoken out about the pressures on young girls to be a size zero after , having becoming obsessed with her own weight , she developed anorexia
but her dramatic weight loss led to horrific consequences when she suddenly collapsed at her family home and was rushed to intensive care .
laura has spoken about her two-year fight with anorexia and revealed the pressures she felt to be thin .
she said : ` at the worst point i was hiding food down the sides of the settee or beds , lying to my mum about having meals , and eating about 100 calories a day .
` i would even try to have mashed potato with each meal so i could hide the rest of the food under it , that way it looked like i 'd ate more . '
after spending a week on a heart monitor at north tyneside general hospital , laura was finally offered support from eating disorder organisations as she began her recovery .
problems started for the teen two years ago when she decided she wanted to go on a diet .
` i was nearly 13 stone and felt like i was too big , ' laura said .
` i 'd been bullied a little bit because of my weight , people saying things like ` here comes the whale ' and that made me feel horrible .
laura was living off just one piece of fruit a day and would hide her food down the side of her bed so her parents would n't see it
laura continued : ` i would look around at the other girls and they all seemed to be skinny and , of course , i wanted to be like them and fit into all the different types of clothes .
` but it was n't just people i knew .
i felt there was a lot of pressures from all over the place .
everywhere you looked there seemed to be this idea that girls should be a size zero . '
laura agreed with mum sue , 48 , to go on a ` sensible diet ' but soon the whitley bay high school pupil became frustrated , wanting to lose more weight , quicker .
according to the nhs anorexia or anorexia nervosa , to give its full name , is a serious mental health condition in which people try to keep their body weight as low as possible .
it is often said that people will often restrict their intake of food , make themselves vomit or increase the amount of exercise they are doing .
the condition often develops in people who are anxious about their body shape or weight , or in those who fear being fat or wish to be thin .
anorexia most commonly occurs in women , starting around the age of 16 or 17 .
although there are cases of men suffering from the disease too .
often people suffering from anorexia will obsessively count calories , take laxatives and repeatedly weight themselves or check their bodies in the mirror .
if you think you know someone who is suffering from the disease talk to them gently about it .
often it can be hard for them to seek help .
you can also seek advice from an eating disorder charity such as beat , who will be able to talk you through how to help them and how to handle the situation .
in february 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the uk - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia .
` it was coming off quite slowly , at about 2 lbs a week , ' said laura .
` but i became much more obsessive about it and decided to reduce my calorie intake .
` in the end , i was virtually eating nothing , maybe an apple or orange a day .
` i could tell my parents were getting worried , they could n't understand why i did n't want to eat . '
lack of food soon took its toll on laura 's health and her heart rate started slowing .
she said : ` i was in bed for three or four days , never going out of the house .
` i would feel dizzy or pass out because my heart rate was so slow . '
finally after a week of eating virtually nothing , laura collapsed .
no happy and healthy laura has made it to the semi final of miss teen gb , the competition aims to stay away from size zero stereotypes
sue , who works in sales , said : ` an ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital and put on the heart monitor for a week .
her body had just started to shut down .
` it was frightening , i was shocked that this was happening to my daughter .
` i remember sitting by her hospital bed and saying "" laura , do you realise how sick you are ? ""
but she just said "" i do n't care , as long as i 'm skinny "" .
` it was then i realised just how much pressure she , and all girls , were under to look a certain way . '
after getting discharged laura began working with eating disorder teams ( edict ) and child and adolescent mental health services ( camhs ) to help in her recovery .
today , her body image is better than ever and her new-found confidence has allowed her to make it through to the semi final of miss teen gb .

"police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place -- despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker .
last night the victim , mike lane , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ` pathetic ' .
he said : ` they could have made more effort .
i 've been told that unless further evidence comes forward , the attackers are not likely to be found .
we find it pathetic . '
attack : mike lane ,40 , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs
a video of the incident and a dossier of evidence , including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers , was given to wiltshire police after the assault .
the attack at everleigh , near amesbury , took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent , rather than a fox .
during the incident , mr lane , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , was sent flying to the ground , before being kicked in the head .
he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .
the face of the thug who kicked mr lane was captured on video .
following the attack , wiltshire police issued the suspect 's photograph , although he has not been identified .
in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr lane said : ` i 've been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence .
it 's angered us because we gave them evidence .
i 'm beginning to lose my trust in the police . '
wiltshire police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country .
this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .
they were looking for trouble -- it was a hardcore element we 'd not seen before .
` they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face .
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth .
i was knocked out for a few minutes .
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar . '
mr lane , who has paid £ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ` i feel let down and think the police could have done more . '
karen fieldsend , 42 , who made the call to police , is furious that the case has been dropped .
` it 's disgraceful , ' she said .
` if you had people assaulted in a city centre , something would be done , but in the countryside people forget about it . '
james cameron , 53 , vice-chairman of the tedworth hunt , added : ` their decision is disappointing , but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings . '

"police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place -- despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker .
last night the victim , mike lane , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ` pathetic ' .

attack : mike lane ,40 , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs
a video of the incident and a dossier of evidence , including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers , was given to wiltshire police after the assault .
the attack at everleigh , near amesbury , took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent , rather than a fox .
during the incident , mr lane , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , was sent flying to the ground , before being kicked in the head .
he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .
the face of the thug who kicked mr lane was captured on video .
following the attack , wiltshire police issued the suspect 's photograph , although he has not been identified .
in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr lane said : ` i 've been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence .
it 's angered us because we gave them evidence .
i 'm beginning to lose my trust in the police . '
wiltshire police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country .
this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .
they were looking for trouble -- it was a hardcore element we 'd not seen before .
` they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face .
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth .
i was knocked out for a few minutes .
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar . '
mr lane , who has paid £ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ` i feel let down and think the police could have done more . '

the new gingham design , presented to supporters at anfield on friday , is the first offering from us sports brand new balance , who struck a record-breaking £ 300million four-year kit deal to replace sister company warrior as liverpool 's suppliers .

only a week ago , sterling held nothing back with his stunning interview after rejecting a new £ 100,000-a-week deal at liverpool .
he also sensationally revealed that he was flattered to be linked with arsenal to cast a huge question mark over his future .
but liverpool are adamant that the 20-year-old , who has two years left to run on his contract , will not be quitting this summer and are putting their shirt on him to stay .
one fan shouted ` make sure we see you in that next season ' at sterling , and the heckle was greeted with applause .
sterling told an expectant audience : ` the fans are great .
it 's a massive boost when you come out of the changing room and hear them sing that song .
you ca n't get better than that .
while players also turned their attention to the fa cup semi-final against aston villa at wembley next weekend .
` it 's special to play at wembley , especially because it 's my home town , ' sterling said .
and sturridge added : ` winning the fa cup would be huge for everyone - players , fans and staff .
we all want to have some success and we hope it 's this season .
winning the cup could be a platform for more success in the future .
` it 's great to play in front of these fans .
it 's an unbelievable feeling .

although departing captain steven gerrard wo n't be around to model liverpool 's new kit next season , his dream of bowing out in the fa cup final on his birthday , may 31 , remains alive .
the new shirt features all white branding -- the new balance logo , the liverbird and the standard chartered logo , whilst there is an all-new style of collar .

"rail firms came under fire this weekend for planning a series of fare hikes of up to 87 per cent just ten days after the general election - despite the main party leaders pledging to freeze prices .
the prime minister has requested first great western ( fgw ) ` urgently review ' its decision to almost double some fares on the route between london and the cotswolds - which passes through his witney constituency .
mr cameron has promised to freeze fares in real terms for the whole of the next parliament , while labour has also pledged to bring in a ` cap ' on price hikes .
sent letter : prime minister david cameron has written to first great western to request it ` urgently reviews ' plans to increase fares on trains running through his witney constituency
passengers travelling from charlbury , the oxfordshire station nearest to his constituency home , can currently purchase an off-peak return to london costing £ 33.30 .
this allows them to leave at 9.42 am , outside the morning peak , but return on one of the four services that go from london during the evening peak period .
but from may 17 , these customers will be forced to pay £ 62.40 if they want to come home on one of these trains - an 87 per cent increase .
the planned changes have angered mr cameron 's constituents - prompting him to personally intervene .
the prime minister 's spokesman told the sunday times : ` mr cameron has written to first great western and asked them to urgently review their decision . '
train companies have three windows every year in which they can increase ` unregulated ' fares , which make up around half of their total revenue .
unregulated fares can include journeys such as off-peak leisure and advance-purchase tickets .
first great western has insisted the reason for the change is to bring the north cotswolds route in line with its other services .
the firm is also offering some customers a cheaper option in advanced single tickets , potentially allowing them to buy a return for £ 20 if they book ahead .
other sharp price hikes to be introduced include an off-peak first-class single from crewe to northampton on london midlands , which will rise from £ 30 to £ 37 , according to trainsplit.com - a website that provides passengers with cheaper ticket options .
the cost of an anytime return between stafford and liverpool , travelling with virgin , will leap from £ 26.50 to £ 33 - a 24.5 per cent hike .
biggest hike : passengers travelling with the rail firm between london and the cotswolds could face increases of up to 87 per cent come may 17
and an anytime first-class day return on virgin from manchester to stoke will go up 22 per cent - rising from £ 29 to £ 35.30 .
virgin has said the ` vast majority ' of its price hikes affected ` virgin trains-only fares ' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms .
it added : ` our overall fare increase this year on the west coast is just 1.65 per cent , well below the industry average . '
speaking to mark hookham of the sunday times , mike richardson , of trainsplit.com , said : ` passengers might very well be surprised at these fare increases when both the main parties have talked about price freeezes .
hundreds of ` anytime ' and ` off-peak ' returns rose by 40 per cent in january .
its research found rail fare increases on tickets that passengers buy on the day and on rural routes .
defended rise : virgin has said the ` vast majority ' of its price hikes affected ` virgin trains-only fares ' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms"," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage:

` it looks like we could get an east coast low later on this week , but it is certainly a different kettle of fish than we 've seen last week , ' ms westcott said .

"rory mcilroy believes it is ` unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam .
and the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at augusta national in 2011 was the most important day of his career .
mcilroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus and tiger woods .
rory mcilroy tees off at the arnold palmer invitational golf tournament in orlando on march 19
` for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland .
` there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year .
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions .
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome .
it would just be incredible .
` you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much .
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . '
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round .
mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month
but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket .

i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on .
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . '
mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel .
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year .
mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added .
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much .
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot .
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position .
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out .
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . '
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february .

it really did , ' he added .
` i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen .

McIlroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles.

"she might be approaching her 89th birthday but nothing was going to stop the queen from enjoying a ride in the spring sunshine this morning .
the monarch , 88 , was spotted trotting through windsor great park aboard her faithful black fell pony , carltonlima emma .
joined by a groom on another of her fell ponies , the queen cut a relaxed figure as she enjoyed her ride but , as is her wont , eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves .
enjoying the sunshine : the queen enjoys a ride on her fell pony carltonlima emma
the queen , who has never worn riding helmets , has been encouraged to wear the safety hats in the past but is reportedly reluctant to wear one because of her hair .
speaking in an interview last year , her racing trainer ian balding recalled the moment he asked why the monarch never wears a riding hat .
the queen is said to have replied : ` i never have and you do n't have to have your hair done like i do . '
her majesty is famous for her love of horses and first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a shetland pony , named peggy , aged four .
since then , the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds , among them betsy , a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50 's , and surprise , a grey gelding whom the queen famously galloped down the course at ascot in 1961 .
equine enthusiast : her majesty adores the ponies and breeds them at hampton court
no helmet : the queen never wears a riding helmet , preferring instead to ride in a silk headscarf
cutting back : she has ridden less in recent years as a result of a niggling knee injury
long term love : the queen has ridden all her life and continues to breed several breeds of horse and pony
recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over trooping the colour on horseback .
nevertheless , the queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and , according to sources , is a familiar sight at her windsor stables .
she is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies , some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren , notably prince edward 's children , lady louise and james , viscount severn .
along with her thoroughbred race horses , the queen also breeds fell ponies and has a stud specialising in highland ponies at balmoral .
first love : the queen 's first pony was a tiny shetland named peggy who was given to her at the age of four
familiar sight : the queen riding her much-loved horse burmese during trooping the colour
seal of approval : a fell pony foal similar to those being bred by the queen at hampton court
one of the oldest equine breeds on the planet , fell ponies like the queen 's mount carltonlima emma , have roamed the moors of cumbria since the neolithic period .
docile , hardy and thick-set , the majority of fell ponies are black , grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh .
highly prized by the carvetii , the iron age tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago , the ponies later caught the eye of the invading romans and were used as trade goods all over the empire .
the romans also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today .
originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall ( similar to dartmoor and exmoor ponies ) , by the end of the roman period , the average fell was more than a hand higher .
another invader to fall in love with the fell pony was the vikings , who used the animals as pack ponies ; a use continued by the normans .
by the 13th century , the fell 's usefulness as a pack animal was well-established and the pony played an important role in british trade until the end of the 18th century .
following the industrial revolution , fells were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town , as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed .
although previously used in trotting races , the fell pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s , when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families .
today , the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages , among them the queen who breeds fell ponies at her hampton court stud .

"the family of the seven-year-old british boy killed in the french alps say his death has left a ` vast void in their hearts ' .
carwyn scott-howell was described as a ` daring , outgoing and determined ' youngster whose ` handsome smile lit up any room ' .

tragedy : carwyn scott-howell ( left ; right ) fell to his death while on holiday with his mother ceri , nine-year-old sister antonia and brother gerwyn , 19 , in the alps
footprints in the snow eventually led police to his body , investigators revealed last night .
they also described how the boy 's mother cari , 44 , desperately tried to find her missing son .
in a moving tribute , carwyn 's family described how he ` made life full of laughter with never a dull moment ' .
` seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky , ' they added .
` carwyn was an adorable , caring person who gave so much love .
the family can not explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts . '
carwyn , from talybont-on-usk in wales , was said to have been a ` very competent skier and snowboarder ' who had started skiing at the age of three .
the family said they had spent ` the most happy ski holiday together ' in the resort of flaine in the days before the tragedy stuck .
they were enjoying their last run of the day when the boy 's sister antonia , nine , lost her ski on a jump and carwyn pressed on ahead .
his mother stopped to help her daughter and continued to the bottom of the piste .
but carwyn -- who modelled himself on the tv adventurer bear grylls -- was nowhere to be seen .
mrs scott-howell returned to their hotel believing her son had made his own way back , but returned to the mountain when she found he was n't there .
pierre-yves michau , the judge heading the investigation , said yesterday : ` she asked everyone if they had seen him . '
it is believed carwyn left the piste and entered woodland because he had spotted the resort through the trees .
taking off his skis , he continued on foot as he hurried to get there .
police chief michel ollagnon confirmed that officers had been led to the boy 's body by footprints in the snow .
he said the final steps were broken up by ` sliding marks ' where carwyn had tackled the sharper inclines on his backside .

"the largest single high-definition map of mysterious dark matter has been produced .
it is the first in a series of maps of the cosmos that will eventually allow a 3d view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky .
and the map should allow astronomers to study how galaxies formed in the universe .
university of manchester researchers have revealed an hd dark matter map ( shown ) .
it shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4 per cent of the sky .
the goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years .
red here shows more dark matter , and blue shows less .
the moon is shown top left for scale
a team from the university of manchester , led by dr sarah bridle , has spent the past two years measuring the shapes of galaxies used to construct the map .
and the map was released today at the april meeting of the american physical society in baltimore , maryland .
it was created using data captured by the dark energy camera , a 570-megapixel imaging device that is the primary instrument for the dark energy survey ( des ) led by fermilab in the us .
the survey uses the 13ft ( four metres ) victor m. blanco telescope located at the cerro tololo inter-american observatory ( ctio ) in chile .
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery .
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces .
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force .
called ` dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe .
and the project is run overall as part of the five-year dark energy survey ( des ) , and is the largest map of this detail .
of course , we ca n't actually directly observe dark matter yet - so the survey instead looks for its noticeable effect on galaxies .
studying this enables the predicted amounts of dark matter in a given area to be mapped , based on its gravitational effects .
` dark matter could equally be called "" transparent matter "" , because we see things behind it that gets distorted by gravity , ' dr bridle told mailonline .
in the map she explained we 're seeing about 150 times the area of the full moon , which is about 0.4 per cent of the whole sky .
the goal of the des is to map 12.5 per cent of the entire sky , creating a 3d map of dark matter - and dark energy .
` it is amazing to see a map of the dark matter over such a large region of the sky , and the full dark energy survey mass map will be more than 30 times bigger still , ' dr bridle said in a separate statement .
` analysis of the clumpiness of the dark matter in the maps will also allow us to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy , believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up . '
this mosaic image shows the different telescope shots that were combined to make the dark matter map .
the survey has just completed its second year .
as scientists expand their search they 'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter
the survey has just completed its second year .
as scientists expand their search , they 'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter .
those theories suggest that , since there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible matter , galaxies will form where there are large concentrations of dark matter ( and hence stronger gravity ) present .
so far , the des analysis backs this up .
the maps show large filaments of matter along which visible galaxies and galaxy clusters lie and cosmic voids where very few galaxies reside .
follow-up studies of some of the enormous filaments and voids , and the enormous volume of data , collected throughout the survey will reveal more about this interplay of mass and light .
these maps show how the amount of dark matter corresponds to the formation rate of galaxies .
on the left , galaxies can be seen near dark matter clumps ( in red ) , and further away from sparse regions ( blue ) .
the image on the right shows some of the regions of sky that were studied
the team at manchester analysed 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies to make the map .
the process of measuring the galaxies is so complex and time consuming that some of the world 's largest supercomputers are needed to do it .
each time a new catalogue is made it takes about as much computing power as running 500 ordinary desktop computers for two weeks .
` we have to measure the shape of each galaxy - how distorted it is - with extremely high precision , about one part in 1000 , ' said dr joe zuntz , also of the university of manchester , who has been making the measurements .
the survey uses the 13ft ( four metres ) victor m. blanco telescope ( middle ) located at the cerro tololo inter-american observatory ( ctio ) in chile , outfitted with a newly designed , state-of-the-art dark energy camera ( decam ) .
it will be completed by 2018 , mapping dark matter of an eighth of the sky in the process
dark matter , the mysterious substance that makes up 85 per cent of all matter in the universe , is invisible to even the most sensitive astronomical instruments because it does not emit or block light .
but its effects can be seen using a technique called gravitational lensing - studying the distortion that occurs when the gravitational pull of dark matter bends light around distant galaxies .
understanding how the clumpiness of dark matter changes with time will reveal the nature of the enigmatic dark energy , which is the ultimate goal of the survey .
the dark matter map released makes use of early des observations and covers only about three percent of the area of sky des will document over its five-year mission ."," The passage describes the largest single high-definition map of dark matter ever produced, covering 0.4% of the sky. The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Victor M. Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.

"tokyo ( cnn ) a bizarre and alarming discovery is raising concerns in japan about the potential for terrorism involving drones .
a drone carrying traces of a radioactive material was found on the rooftop of japan 's equivalent to the white house on wednesday , police and government officials said .
the discovery came on the same day a japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the sendai nuclear power plant in kagoshima prefecture , more than four years after the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster .
prime minister shinzo abe 's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many japanese , who view nuclear energy as too dangerous .
a staff member spotted the drone wednesday morning on the roof of abe 's residence , tokyo metropolitan police said .
dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone , which had four propeller and was 50 centimeters ( 20 inches ) wide .
police say the drone was equipped with a small camera , smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium , a common byproduct of nuclear reactors .
cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed fukushima daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown .
investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle .
the amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans .
chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said the discovery is raising concerns about terrorism .
"" there might be terrorism attempts in the future at the olympics and g7 summit using drones , "" suga said .
"" so we need to examine and review continuously the way small unmanned vehicles like drones should be operated and how to cope with the threat of terrorism from drones .
the government will do all that we can to prevent terrorism . ""
japanese law restricts drone flights around airports to prevent problems with aircraft , but there are no flight restrictions for most of tokyo , including the prime minister 's residence and local and federal government buildings .

"tony abbott may have thrilled players at an australian rules function by skolling a beer but he’s drawn the ire of anti-drinking campaigners who claim he’s glorifying binge drinking and associating being a man with drinking booze . julie robert , a cultural studies professor at the university of technology sydney , said it was ' problematic ' that the prime minister , who she believes should be advocating against binge drinking , thought it acceptable to ' showcase his masculinity ' by skolling a beer . ‘ it sets up a culture that drinking isn’t about socialising with friends , it’s about how quickly and how much you can drink , ’ she said . scroll down for video . australian prime minister tony abbott was cheered on by a crowd of about 50 as he skolled a schooner of beer . mr abbott came under fire after the incident as anti-drinking campaigners said he was glorifying binge drinking . ‘ it sets up a culture that drinking isn’t about socialising with friends , it’s about how quickly and how much you can drink . ’ on saturday night mr abbott appeared happy to oblige when he was asked to have a drink by university of technology sydney bats coach simon carradous . it took the prime minister about six seconds to down the schooner as players cheered and chanted ' skol ' and ' tony ' . dr robert warned people can forget their limits when they are wrapped up in the act of demonstrating how much , or how quickly , they can drink . ' it is the whole performance and the display and showing off which is the problematic part , ' she told daily mail australia . however , she said it was not just mr abbott 's skol that was concerning , it was also the way media and other government officials have reacted to the event . in an interview on sunday , opposition leader bill shorten quipped that he was ' just pleased that tony abbott’s learning to drink beer without adding lemonade to it ' . mr abbott was labelled 'un-australian ' for ordering a light beer during his 2010 campaign . dr robert said while drinking was a part of the australian tradition , it was dangerous to make comments that would only glorify irresponsible drinking practices and perpetuate the stereotype that drinking heavily makes you a true blue aussie bloke . critics said he should be setting an example that you do n't have to drink heavily to be a ' true blue aussie bloke ' . it appeared to take the prime minister about six seconds to down the schooner , as players cheered and chanted ' skol ' and ' tony ' . health minister sussan ley was quick to jump to mr abbott 's defence saying there was ' nothing wrong ' with the prime minister 's antics . “ if more people got up at 4.30 in the morning and went running and cycling and worked as hard as our prime minister to keep fit and demonstrate that there are many ways that you can do this , i think we’d have a healthier country as a result , ’’ ms ley said . during his night out , mr abbott gave a speech to the players , according to australian women 's weekly .

' then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner , dribbling little bits on his shirt ... he was proud as punch . ' while mr abbott is not the first australian prime minister to show off his skolling skills , with former labor prime minister bob hawke a notable example , dr roberts said he should have taken into consideration recent shifts in attitudes over heavy drinking .

{"meta_id": 655, "summary": "Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:\n\nA major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that heavy drinking among Americans rose 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, driven largely by women's drinking habits. The study defines heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. Binge drinking, defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion, increased more than seven times the rate among men. Women's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36% in Santa Clara County, CA, between 2002 and 2012, compared to 23% among men. The study suggests that changing social norms and the increasing acceptability of women drinking like men may be contributing factors.

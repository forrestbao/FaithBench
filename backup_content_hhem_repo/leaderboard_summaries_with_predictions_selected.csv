"The Seasiders struck with the first real chance after 12 minutes as Nathan Delfouneso jinked past his man and delivered a pinpoint chip into the area, where Jamille Matt turned the ball home from three yards. Blackpool goalkeeper Sam Slocombe denied Matthew Briggs with a sensational save to push the ball behind after 17 minutes, but the visitors did equalise from the resulting corner as Kurtis Guthrie prodded in from close range after a goalmouth scramble. Somehow, Colchester failed to re-take the lead on the stroke of half-time as Slocombe produced a brilliant save from George Elokobi's close-range effort, before Guthrie headed against the bar from two yards.

"Earlier this week, he refused to answer the question of whether he believed homosexual sex was a sin. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he was ""passionate about LGBT-plus rights"" and defending equal marriage would be ""at the top of my agenda"". He also said he wanted to extend the marital rights of transgender people. Appearing on Channel 4 News on Friday, Mr Farron, who beat Norman Lamb to the leadership, was asked three times if he believed homosexual sex was a sin. Each time, he refused to give a direct answer, instead choosing to say ""my firm belief is we are all sinners"". Mr Farron was asked by Andrew Marr why he voted against the Equality Bill in 2007 - a law which would have made it harder for businesses to discriminate against gay people. ""Let me be crystal clear, I'm a liberal and I absolutely support equality,"" he replied. ""I'm passionate about LGBT-plus rights, for example, and as the leader of a liberal party, that is something that will be at the top of my agenda throughout the time that I am leader of our party. ""Not just defending the law on equal marriage, but also saying there are areas where it needs to be extended."" Mr Farron said transgender people currently did not have equal access to marriage due to something known as the spousal veto - which means the husband or wife of someone who has changed gender must give their consent in order for the marriage to continue. He said the Lib Dems tabled an amendment to the Equality Bill because of concerns about ""protection of individual liberties"" and when that was defeated he voted against the bill. He did not answer directly when asked what those concerns were, but said: ""I am absolutely in favour of equal access under law for all people whatever their sexuality.""","The passage discusses the views of Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey on homosexuality and LGBT-plus rights.

"Pte Matthew Boyd, 20, was off-duty on a night out in Brecon when he was punched and beaten by Jake Vallely. But the jury cleared Vallely's friend Aaeron Evans of manslaughter after Cardiff Crown Court was told he was not present during the attack. Vallely, 24, will be sentenced on 8 December. The unconscious body of Pte Boyd, who served with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, was found by police in the town in the early hours of 8 May. Pte Boyd, who is originally from Carrickfergus, County Antrim, had been in the town for training exercises at the infantry battle school. During the trial, the court heard Pte Boyd was making his way back to the barracks when he was attacked outside a bar called The Cellar. CCTV footage showed the soldier being punched, going to the ground and being beaten until he no longer moved. Vallely then dragged his body from the scene before fleeing. The trial was told the killer had been on a seven hour drinking binge and in the hour before the attack was boasting he was the ""hardest man in Brecon"". His friend Mr Evans was cleared of any involvement in the attack, after the jury was told he had left the scene before the start of any violence. Senior investigating officer Det Supt David Guiney, from Dyfed-Powys Police, called the attack ""a despicable act"" that ""shocked"" the community of Brecon. ""I plead with anyone who plans a night out drinking with their friends to please, walk away from any conflict, do not resort to violence,"" he said.

He was loving, caring and loyal. He was always playing jokes on his peers and family, and always brought smiles to our faces."" It said Vallely had created ""a void in our family that will never be filled"", adding the ""unbearable pain"" was something they will have to live with for the rest of their lives. ""During this trial, it has been mentioned that Jake Vallely called himself the 'hardest man in Brecon' on the night that he murdered Matthew,"" the tribute said. ""He couldn't have been more wrong.

"The paper ran a front page headline calling the comedian a ""hypocrite"" because he campaigns for economic and political ""revolution"" to help poorer people, yet he lives in a luxury home. It's an accusation often made against the star. How can such a rich man claim to speak up for the poor? Viewers of Brand's vlogs - The Trews - are familiar with the inside of his spacious London home. It looks lovely and airy. It has wooden floors and exposed brickwork. When the St Trinian's star was outside the prime minister's Downing Street home - supporting a campaign by residents of an east London estate who fear they will be turfed out of their homes to allow richer renters to move in - Brand was asked about his own accommodation by a TV reporter. ""Part of the problem is the super-rich buying property in London, isn't it? What kind of rent are you paying?"" Brand wasn't very happy with the question. He called the Channel 4 News journalist ""a snide"", before walking off. Newsbeat contacted Brand to see if he was really going to take legal action against The Sun and its owner Rupert Murdoch. He didn't reply, though he has been tweeting about The Sun and it's accusations of hypocrisy - using the hashtag #TheSunLogic. The star's been condemned as a hypocrite plenty of times before. Here's how he's explained it in the past. ""Don't think I'm unaware of the inevitability of such a charge. I know, I know. I'm rich, I'm famous, I have money... There is no doubt that I as much as anyone have to change. ""Revolution is change. I believe in change, personal change most of all. Know, too that I have seen what fame and fortune have to offer and I know it's not the answer. ""Of course I have to change as an individual and part of that will be sharing wealth, though without systemic change, that will be a sweet, futile gesture."" ""I can't deny that I've done a lot of daft things while I was under the capitalist fugue, some silly telly, soppy scandals, movies better left unmade. ""It's easy to attack me, I'm a right twerp, I'm a junkie and a cheeky monkey, I accept it, but that doesn't detract from the incontrovertible fact that we are living in a time of huge economic disparity and confronting ecological disaster."" ""Now I'm rich and I complain about inequality they say I'm a hypocrite. I'm beginning to think they just don't want inequality on the agenda because it is a real problem that needs to be addressed."" ""A system that has posited me on a lilo made of thighs in an ocean filled with honey and foie gras'd my Essex arse with undue praise and money.

"Jamie Carragher believes Brendan Rodgers is still the right man to lead Liverpool forward after a season with no trophies and a likely finish outside the top four.

Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. Jamie Carragher shared this image on Instagram after collecting a Beacon Award on Tuesday . 'It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.'

It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. 'There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'", Jamie Carragher has backed Brendan Rodgers to stay as Liverpool manager.

"Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January . A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved. 'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.' Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts . Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail. It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton.

"But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. ""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"". The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. ""I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,"" said Mr Mason."," Here is a concise summary of the key information in the passage:  - A study found 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools in the UK use tablet computers to some degree. 9% of schools provide a tablet for every student. Use is highest in academy schools.   - Between 2014-2016, the number of tablets in UK schools is expected to double from 430,000 to 900,000.   - There is no definitive evidence tablets improve academic results, but they can motivate disengaged students. Tablets also increase family involvement when students take them home.    - Most students take internet-connected devices to bed, using them for social media and watching videos.   - The role of technology in schools is expected to continue growing.

"Pakistan's telecoms regulator said the ban was no longer necessary because Google, which owns YouTube, had now launched a Pakistan-specific version. YouTube has denied claims that the authorities can filter content. Many young Pakistanis have welcomed the lifting of the ban but some activists want details of the deal with Google. They say there should be greater transparency of the terms agreed between Google and the government. A Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) official confirmed to the BBC that all internet service providers had been directed to open access to YouTube. The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd posted on its Facebook page on Monday: ""Welcome Back YouTube"". Pakistan's ministry of information technology said: ""Google has provided an online web process through which requests for blocking access of offending material can be made by the PTA to Google directly. ""Google/YouTube will accordingly restrict access to the said offending material for users within Pakistan."" However, a YouTube spokeswoman said government requests for the removal of content would not automatically be granted. ""We have clear community guidelines, and when videos violate those rules, we remove them,"" she said. ""In addition, where we have launched YouTube locally and we are notified that a video is illegal in that country, we may restrict access to it after a thorough review."" She said requests by governments for content to be removed would be recorded in YouTube's Transparency Report. Pakistan's ban on YouTube was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the US-made film Innocence of Muslims was uploaded.

"The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. ""Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,"" he was once quoted as saying.And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.""Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,"" he said.During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work ""any monkey"" could do.The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.""I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,"" he said of the synthetic microbes.""If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide."""," Here is a concise summary of the key information in the passage:  Craig Venter is a biologist and entrepreneur who sped up efforts to map the human genome by turning it into a race, drawing criticism from the scientific community. He went on to help create the first synthetic life form, Synthia, as part of a decade-long project. Venter did not originally excel in academics but was inspired to become a doctor after serving in Vietnam. He shifted his focus from medical practice to research, realizing the importance of decoding genes. Venter pioneered new gene sequencing methods that greatly accelerated the process. Though controversial for his unconventional approach, he secured private funding to continue his genomic research after leaving the NIH. His work has advanced the field of genomics and synthetic biology, with potential applications in medicine, energy and the environment.",claude,1,0.5171635151,0,0.3623490036,1,0.8681935668,1,0
"Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. “Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?” This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began."," Here is a concise summary of the key information in the passage:  The passage describes the unveiling of the original iPhone in 2007 and how it revolutionized mobile technology. The author recalls being one of the first journalists to get hands-on access to the new iPhone before its release. He initially questioned whether the iPhone would truly transform mobile devices.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Emotion. Drama. Excitement. Brilliant football. Noise. Colour. And all this even before Liverpool's Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The Kop in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre. It was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's almost crazed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund, the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel. Liverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe's second-rate pot - not a label anyone was attaching to it after this classic. Liverpool into last four after Euro thriller Istanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp Liverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan When Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October, he revealed one of his priorities was to ""turn doubters into believers"". And it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory, both on the pitch and in the stands. If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened. In nine blistering minutes from the first whistle, this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart, with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration. Liverpool needed three goals, leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005, saying: ""Even if it is not likely it is possible, so we should try."" And yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice, Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes. It was time for believers, time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon. And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touchstone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren. Borussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw-dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up. It takes us back to more words from Klopp. After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early, saying it made him feel alone and adding: ""We decide when it's over."" This was a phrase that could have been stamped on the foreheads of Liverpool's players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do. If anyone entered Anfield as a doubter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left. This night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour, the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The Kop. Before the teams emerged, Anfield was serenaded by arguably the longest version of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" ever heard at the stadium, Gerry Marsden's voice turned off and Liverpool's supporters taking over, the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence. A minute's silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed, Anfield a cauldron of emotions. It was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages, cut to pieces by high-class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere. Slowly, after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit, the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were unnerved to the point where their resolve was broken. Klopp was a man possessed on the touchline, waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players, pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise. It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night. Tuchel said: ""When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change. There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be. Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmospheres ever at a football match."" Klopp added: ""It was brilliant, outstanding, emotional, everything. I will not forget it because it was special. I know this is a place for big football moments. We didn't start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories."" There was certainly a new, unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night. In the afterglow of such sporting brilliance, there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool's performance. It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed. And yet, when there is time for reflection, it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool. Divock Origi's goal, his fourth in his past three games, was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge. Even as Liverpool battled Dortmund's supremacy, Origi showed power, pace and a willingness to fight. Very much the Klopp template, recalling the words of his manager after his first game in charge at Tottenham six months ago: ""We're going to have a lot of fun with this player."" Media playback is not supported on this device Emre Can has had a mixed season but was outstanding before picking up an injury, while Coutinho sprinkles the stardust on this Liverpool team. It seems like splitting hairs after such a glorious spectacle, but Liverpool still have a vulnerability at the back that will surely be addressed by Klopp in the summer. Alberto Moreno is a weak link at left-back and while Sakho may be a popular figure with supporters, talking of ""a win for the Liverpool country"" and taking selfies on the pitch with Origi, close inspection suggests his positional play was something of an adventure for Dortmund's goals. One thing is clear, however, and qualifies as the biggest plus of all - in the space of six months Klopp has imprinted his identity on his new players and Liverpool's fans. The evidence was all over Anfield. Most definitely - indeed many felt the winner of this tie would go on to claim the trophy. It was not a notion welcomed or encouraged by Klopp. Sevilla, winners for the last two seasons, still lurk after beating Athletic Bilbao on penalties while another Spanish side Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up a high-powered last four. But there is almost the spirit of Champions League 2005 about Liverpool's run in the Europa League. Back then Liverpool moved along with no great expectation to not only find themselves in the final but winning it. Klopp will guard against any complacency but the way in which Liverpool pulled off an extraordinary feat on Thursday will give them growing confidence that no task is too onerous for them at Anfield in the semi-finals. The Europa League is not the only prize within reach - a return to the Champions League via victory in this tournament is now tantalisingly coming into view. The famous ""This Is Anfield"" sign has greeted players on the path to the pitch for decades - many touch it for luck and Klopp even did so himself on a visit to the stadium for a friendly when coach of Borussia Dortmund. It carries an aura but Klopp has put a banning order on his players, saying: ""I've told my players you need to win something before you touch the 'This Is Anfield'. It's a sign of respect. You don't do it - it is too big."" Klopp has delivered another incentive to his Liverpool charges.","Liverpool advanced to the semi-finals of the Europa League on Thursday night after a breathtaking 4-3 win in front of The Kop. Borussia Dortmund raced into a two-goal lead inside nine minutes thanks to strikes from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but Divock Origi pulled one back for the Reds. Despite Marco Reus re-establishing the visitors' two-goal cushion just before the half-hour mark, Philippe Coutinho struck to make it 2-2 at the break. Mamadou Sakho then put Liverpool ahead for the first time just after the hour, but the Reds were denied a place in the last four when Aubameyang scored with two minutes left. However, there was to be a stunning finale to a classic European encounter when Dejan Lovren headed home in injury time to take Liverpool through.",cohere,1,0.5493611693,0,0.30950436,1,0.5295076966,0,1

"The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday. The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.","The UN has agreed to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system following the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 nearly two years ago.

"Craig Hughes, 33, of Flint, was arrested by North Wales Police in August after he chatted online with the Hope Line Crisis Centre in Tennessee. Fears were raised over a planned murder bid involving police being ambushed after reports of a non-existent crime. Hughes admitted two charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday. He will be sentenced next week. Hughes said he was planning to make a false report to the police so that officers would come to the scene, prosecutors said while outlining the case earlier in the proceedings. He said he would then shoot them on the Dee Estuary. The threats were made on two occasions, late at night, while Hughes was drunk. Judge Niclas Parry, who was told the defendant had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2009, remanded him in custody pending sentence. During a previous hearing, Hughes's legal team said he had not intended to kill himself and would not have carried out any threat to kill police officers. The court heard at the time, North Wales Police was particularly concerned because the defendant was on bail, awaiting trial for firearms offences, of which he was subsequently cleared. The Hope Line centre offers confidential support and counselling to people experiencing difficulty.","Here is a concise summary of the given passage:  In August 2022, a man from Flint, named Craig Hughes, was arrested by North Wales Police after an online chat in which he made plans to shoot police officers on the Dee Estuary if they responded to a false report he intended to make; as he was drunk, this potentially constituted a botched suicide attempt.

"For many people with severe disabilities, their families and carers, this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house. In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven't got a suitable area to spend a penny. Ordinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet?"" Recommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory. Lorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory ""It's like playing Russian roulette,"" Lorna says. ""Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful. ""My daughter is only six so she doesn't have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through, but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty."" Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people. There are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they? They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet  the needs of people who use them. Mike LeSurf, Changing Places Development Officer at Mencap says: ""There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door, people's needs are not being met."" Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away. ""Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn't a bench and hoist in the toilet,"" she says. ""You just begin to get this sense of feeling like you're last in the line to be considered. ""It's soul-destroying and you don't feel like a valued member of society at all."" But it is not all doom and gloom and Alison gets by with a little help from her friends. She said: ""Freddie went to a party and one of my friends converted a room into a 'pop-up' changing places, and brought stuff from home to kit it out - it was amazing"" Alison even tweeted from the party: ""Friends for life are those who organise parties in the village hall and provide a 'pop up' #changingplace so ALL can go!"" Bethan Folen and her daughter Lowri also enjoy their ""girls' days out"" now there are more convenient and fully accessible places to change nearby. She said: ""Lowri's favourite thing to do is to go to the Millennium Stadium [now known as the Principality Stadium] in Cardiff and watch Wales play rugby. She is a massive fan. Even before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet, says Bethan, ""There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change Lowri"" Changing Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines (BS 8300:2009) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement. Architect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem. ""By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment,"" she says. ""As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this."" For businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans. At 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m). Because of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations. Arsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too. Alun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: ""There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt. ""But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience. ""They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible. ""You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important.""","There are currently no fully accessible toilets (called Changing Places) available for people with severe disabilities and their carers, which results in them being unable to go out as they often require use of a hoist and a bench, rather than a standard toilet, for changing.  Recommendations to install these specialised toilets in larger buildings (such as shopping centres and cinemas) are in place, however, campaigners are pushing for these recommendations to become compulsory.  Lorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, has started a petition to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory and has submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee.  There are approximately 250,000 people in the UK who require the use of a Changing Places toilet.",cohere-chat,1,0.5082677603,0,0.3817642033,1,0.6850175261,0,1

"It comes in a shake-up of UK military buildings and resettling of regiments. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure, saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805, home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke's Drift. ""This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way,"" he said. ""The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town. ""Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history, with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century. ""This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history."" Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision, saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales. He also hoped the closure would not damage the town's ""thriving"" military tourism industry. Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk. Mr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. Cawdor Barracks, Pembrokeshire - whose closure was previously announced in 2013 - will now shut in 2024, while a storage depot at Sennybridge will go in 2025. Responding for Labour, Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith, MP for Llanelli, said the ministry was ""right to restructure its estate"". But she warned closing bases would affect the livelihoods of many people who would face ""gnawing uncertainty"" over their future.","The defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, has announced that Brecon Barracks will close in 2025, but that there will be no job losses as a result; furthermore, the plan is to create a specialist light infantry centre at St Athan in South Wales.

"Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: ""Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate. ""School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet."" Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: ""Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. ""From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat. ""School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety."" School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines. About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools.

"Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes. First, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster. Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time. The win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break. Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury. But his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it. Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction. The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years. That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768. Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players. Yet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour. Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges. Austin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge. Virgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark. That was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire. The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort. Dawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar. Hull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: ""I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough. ""The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character. ""Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."" Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: ""We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation. ""After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future.

"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

"The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. ""Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,"" he was once quoted as saying.And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.""Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,"" he said.During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work ""any monkey"" could do.The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.""I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,"" he said of the synthetic microbes.""If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide."""," Sure!

The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home.

And the former Schalke man says he is finally adjusting to English football, claiming he fits in 'perfectly'. 'There are a lot of what we call 'English weeks' in Germany - where you play twice, and there's no winter break either,' he said. 'It's demanding because you don't have many breaks to recover, but as a footballer it's great to have so many games and I'm the sort of player who prefers playing in many matches - that's why I fit perfectly here.'

"Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance. Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner. Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on. Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies. The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge. The win lifted Mick McCarthy's Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: ""The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three. ""With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team. ""We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been."" QPR boss Ian Holloway:  ""I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn't have. ""The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five. ""Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him.

"However the Spanish champions insisted they had not committed any offence.

Barca paid £48.6m for Santos striker Neymar, 22, in the summer with his parents receiving £34m of the fee.

He is also being investigated but denies any wrongdoing. At the time of the move, Barcelona said they had paid 57m euros (£48.6m) for Neymar but it has been alleged that, if other contracts are taken into account, the actual cost of the player was far greater. And last week a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer. The club added: ""The board denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player. ""Given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing and to defend the club's reputation and good name, FC Barcelona has this morning made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros [...] although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations.""

"Pte Matthew Boyd, 20, was off-duty on a night out in Brecon when he was punched and beaten by Jake Vallely.

The unconscious body of Pte Boyd, who served with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, was found by police in the town in the early hours of 8 May. Pte Boyd, who is originally from Carrickfergus, County Antrim, had been in the town for training exercises at the infantry battle school. During the trial, the court heard Pte Boyd was making his way back to the barracks when he was attacked outside a bar called The Cellar. CCTV footage showed the soldier being punched, going to the ground and being beaten until he no longer moved. Vallely then dragged his body from the scene before fleeing. The trial was told the killer had been on a seven hour drinking binge and in the hour before the attack was boasting he was the ""hardest man in Brecon"". His friend Mr Evans was cleared of any involvement in the attack, after the jury was told he had left the scene before the start of any violence.

"The former five-weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline. The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: ""I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves."" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified. ""Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,"" said Bennett. ""To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine."" During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: ""I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands."" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision. McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin. But Bennett says he studied a ""litany of information"" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were ""several reasons to approve the fight"". Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion. ""I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,"" said Bennett. ""He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer. ""Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer. ""Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself. ""That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight."" McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: ""He's good to go."" He also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73. Cortez said he oversaw an ""out of control"" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session."," Sure, here is a concise summary of the passage: The former five-weight world champion, Conor McGregor, submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) on Wednesday, hours before the deadline, in order to fight Floyd Mayweather Jr. The NAC rules state that fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves, but McGregor's team had requested to use 8oz gloves, which the NAC will now debate on August 16.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","          [/INST] In August 2019, militants armed with guns and grenades attacked a hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park. The fourth-tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday, but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian. Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross.

"They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy ""sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment"". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as ""sexier"" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. ""There's a huge market for our timber. Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill,"" he added.","The Welsh government wants to balance environmental, economic and social aspects in forestry development.

Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"".

One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building.

The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over. ""I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems,"" FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport. Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty. The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared. The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup. Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption. ""We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence,"" said Snoussi. ""But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium."" ""But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. ""We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected. ""In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match."" Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement. ""Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,"" said Snoussi. ""We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out."" Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F. Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.","Tunisia and Morocco were both facing potential disqualification from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. Tunisia had complained to CAF about the organization of the 2015 tournament, while Morocco had been banned from participating in the 2015 tournament after refusing to host it. However, both countries were able to avoid disqualification after apologizing to CAF and reaching agreements with the organization.  Tunisia's complaint was related to a penalty that was awarded to Equatorial Guinea in the quarter-finals of the 2015 tournament. Tunisia was leading 1-0 at the time, but the penalty allowed Equatorial Guinea to equalize and eventually win the match in extra time. Tunisia felt that the penalty was unfair and wrote a letter to CAF expressing their concerns. CAF responded by demanding that Tunisia apologize by March 31, 2015, or face disqualification from the 2017 tournament.  Tunisia eventually apologized to CAF and was allowed to participate in the 2017 tournament. They were drawn into Group A with Togo, Liberia, and Djibouti. Morocco, on the other hand, was not allowed to participate in the 2015 tournament after refusing to host it. Morocco had asked CAF to postpone the tournament due to fears of the Ebola virus, but CAF refused. Morocco then withdrew from the tournament and was banned from participating in the 2017 tournament as well.  However, Morocco was able to have its ban overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). CAS ruled that CAF had not followed its own rules when it banned Morocco and ordered CAF to allow Morocco to participate in the 2017 tournament. Morocco was drawn into Group F with Cape Verde, Libya, and São Tomé and Príncipe.  Both Tunisia and Morocco will be looking to make a strong showing at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. Tunisia will be looking to win their first title since 2004, while Morocco will be looking to make their first appearance in the tournament since 2004.",palm-chat,1,0.7805353999,0,0.4086377323,1,0.5379137993,0,1

"Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: ""Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate. ""School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet."" Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: ""Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. ""From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat. ""School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety."" School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines. About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools. More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%. The survey was conducted online between 26 February and 5th March among a panel of parents who had at least one child in school aged 4-17 years old.","In England, a study found that 80% of children who had school lunches tried foods they hadn't eaten at home.

The research was commissioned by England's School Food Trust after a Mumsnet survey suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches due to their fussiness. The Trust's chairman, Rob Rees, stated that school meals can help children try new foods and diversify their diets. Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, added that school meals have improved and offer healthier options, encouraging children to eat a variety of foods.

Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing. Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012. He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team. ""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project."" Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League. Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack. Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille. Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final. Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield. Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals. ""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them. ""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well."" Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ""He gives something different, a massive presence up front. ""It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. ""He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad.

"The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000. The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe. In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection. Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus. It can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost. That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes. The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece. The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy. ""Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc. ""Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,"" he told BBC News. Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida. The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the ""revolution"" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan. The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year. Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace. The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight. More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth. There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade. OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage. Equity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a ""truly global company"" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority. ""A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,"" said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger. ""And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries."" One aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions. The fear is that space could eventually become unusable. A recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other. Brian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation. ""We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,"" he told BBC News. ""We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit."" Time will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole. Airbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment. ""Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,” said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.

"(CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle ""Shelly"" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. ""This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,"" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. ""It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts."" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" Sterling said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise. Fact check: Donald Sterling's claims vs. reality . CNN's Dottie Evans contributed to this report.","<bos>**Summary:**  A Los Angeles judge has ordered V.

And we looked at each other and said 'It's Harry'. We knew, we knew even then."" The trial at Newcastle Crown Court heard Dhillon had become obsessed with the 24-year-old and had stalked her. Dr Hills told of her guilt about trying to reassure her daughter on the phone two days before. She said: ""And I sort of reassured her that was ok, the police knew what was going on and that it would be all right and if she just ignored him he would ignore her. ""And I only put the phone down for 10 minutes and Emma (daughter) rang and said 'You cannot tell that to her, he's going to kill her. You have got to do something'. ""And I thought she was over-reacting so I just said 'don't be silly'. ""And so of course as soon as I saw the police I knew that's that what it was. ""And I felt such a sense of guilt for having first of all told Alice not to worry and secondly told Emma not to be silly when actually if I hadn't said that Alice might still be alive."" Prof Ruggles said he didn't think any of them, including his daughter, realised how serious the situation was despite the signs. Her parents have set up the Alice Ruggles Trust and they said they were hoping to use that and their daughter's ""vibrant personality"" to make other people aware of the dangers of stalking. They said they wanted her to be remembered for that and as ""smiling and laughing and making some sort of cheeky comment."" Dhillon, 26, denied murder but was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years.","<bos>**Summary:**  Lance Corporal Trimaan Dhillon stalked and fatally attacked Alice Ruggles, who was 24 years old.

"Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."" Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."" In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."" Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. ""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

City captain Vincent Kompany was dismissed for two bookable offences during Belgium's narrow 1-0 defeat of Israel in their Euro 2016 qualifier on March 31, meaning he is now suspended for the match against Wales in June. And, although Clattenburg has been accused of favouring Louis van Gaal's side in the past, it's worth noting that the 40-year-old has only sent off two players season in the Premier League this season and both have been from United; Tyler Blackcett in the 5-3 defeat by Leicester and Luke Shaw in the 1-1 draw with West Ham. Mark Clattenburg will officiate the Manchester derby between United and City at Old Trafford . The English referee sent off City and Belgium captain Vincent Kompany during the international break . Leicester 5-3 Manchester United . West Ham 1-1 Manchester United . Manchester United 3-0 Tottenham . Manchester City 3-1 West Ham . Liverpool 2-1 Manchester City . Chelsea 1-1 Manchester City . Clattenburg has courted controversy during his career but is generally regarded as one of the Premier League's leading referees alongside Michael Oliver. The champion's shock 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday saw United move a point above their local rivals to add extra incentive for both sides ahead of the derby at Old Trafford, which could ultimately decide who finishes second behind expected winners Chelsea. While Manuel Pellegrini's side have struggled since the turn of the year, turning from title challengers to fourth place chases, United are coasting on confidence having won their last five consecutive league games. Clattenburg will be joined on Sunday by assistants Simon Beck and Jake Collin, while Jonathan Moss will serve as the fourth official.

"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

"A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded. Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

"French firm EDF, which is financing most of the £18bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset, approved the funding at a board meeting. Contracts were to be signed on Friday. But Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the government will ""consider carefully"" before backing it. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz has cancelled a trip to Hinkley Point on Friday following Mr Clark's comments. Critics of the plan have warned of environmental damage and potential escalating costs. They are also concerned that the plant is being built by foreign governments. One third of the £18bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors. Hours after EDF's board voted to approve the £18bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project. This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact. EDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished. Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy? Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible. ""We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies,"" he said. ""Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments."" Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was ""yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties"". Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement. Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as ""a unique asset for French and British industries"", saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment. However, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity. Despite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners. Earlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise €4bn (£3.4bn) to help pay for the project. Ahead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was ""very risky"" financially. Earlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself. 5,600 workers on site at peak 4,000km electrical cabling 230,000 tonnes of steel 5.6m cubic metres of earth to be moved Environmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: ""Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money. He added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, ""doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians"". The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind. Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mix Mar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approved Oct 2013 - UK government agrees £92.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the time Oct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn.","Here is a concise summary of the passage:  The French firm EDF has approved funding for the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project in Somerset, but the UK government has launched a further review of the project, citing concerns about environmental damage, potential escalating costs, and foreign investment.

"Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: ""Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate. ""School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet."" Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: ""Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. ""From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat. ""School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety."" School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines. About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools.

"France's Dubuisson carded a 67 to tie with overnight leader Van Zyl of South Africa on 16 under par. McIlroy carded a third straight five under-par 67 to move to 15 under par with Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat. The world number three's round included an eagle on the 12th as he bids to win his first title since May. ""The 67s I've shot this week have all been a little different and I feel like I've played within myself for all of them, "" said four-time major winner McIlroy of Northern Ireland. ""I feel there's a low round out there for me and hopefully it's tomorrow."" McIlroy was level par for the day after 10 holes, dropping his first shots of the week by three-putting the third and 10th, the latter mistake prompting the 26-year-old to throw his putter at his bag. But he hit back with a birdie on the par-five 11th and a towering four iron from 229 yards on the 13th set up an eagle from just four feet. The former world number one ruptured a ligament in his left ankle during a game of football with friends in July, ruling him out of several tournaments. But he returned in time to unsuccessfully defend his US PGA title at Whistling Straits in August and played in three of the FedEx Cup play-off events before starting the new PGA Tour season with a tie for 26th in the Frys.com Open in California.

"The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: ""The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.""","Here is a concise summary of the passage:  NHS Improvement aims to reduce the NHS's agency staff bill from £3.6bn to £2.6bn by the end of the financial year.

Despite ""promising"" progress, the NHS is still 10% short of its target, and it's unclear if spending on other parts of the pay bill has increased.

"The girl, aged 15 at the time, had met a man called David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage in the autumn of 2004. The defendant, now 34 and called Davina, denied the charge. She will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody and said it was likely she would be held at a male prison. He added: ""If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason. ""I will therefore have to remand in custody. It will have to be a male prison in Winchester but it will be an issue for the prison service."" He also told the jury at Portsmouth Crown Court: ""It's been a slightly unusual case and it's not been an easy case."" The court heard that Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, attempted to commit suicide last summer. Protocols have been put in place for her detention at the prison, a court officer explained. During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not ""made any physical changes or enhancements"" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage. The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had ""only drunk a can and a half of Foster's"" and clearly recollected the events. The court heard that in 2014 Ayrton told a worker at the care home where she lived in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, about the attack.","1.

"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use . heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health . the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men . binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month . the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found . in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men . nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men . opinion : why are more women drinking ?

It emphasizes the need to move beyond simply telling girls they can be anything and actively combat the biases that limit their potential.

"" "" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , "" rios wrote in a facebook post . if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president . throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making . studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts . if science does n't convince you , just google "" cheating politicians "" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them . rios has taken a lot of flak for her "" biblically "" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern . time magazine declared hillary clinton the "" perfect "" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is "" biologically primed "" to lead . ( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . ) believe me , i wish i were . no wonder jon stewart left "" the daily show "" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing . if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed . but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias . we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything . and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force . but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed . unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique . some people believe women have "" our place "" and that place is not at the table . they 'll tell your daughter to "" go for it "" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams . in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes . the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless . it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether . the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as "" geniuses "" and the women as "" nice . "" the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it . hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb . that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone . the fact is , equality benefits everyone . it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) . it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful . it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages . and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results . our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men . it 's not enough to say to our daughters : "" you can be anything you want to be . "" what we need to say is : "" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . "" rios said that if clinton is elected , she is "" moving to canada "" because "" a female should n't be president . "" apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 2001 . correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .","## Summary of the Passage:  The passage discusses the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's potential presidency and the role of gender bias in leadership positions.   **Key Points:**  * **Hormones and Leadership:** The article starts by addressing the claim that female hormones make women unfit for leadership, using Hillary Clinton as an example. It refutes this claim by highlighting historical examples of poor decision-making by male leaders and research showing women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks. * **Gender Bias in the Workplace:** The core issue, the article argues, is not biology but deeply ingrained gender bias against women in leadership roles. This bias manifests in various ways, from overt discrimination to subtle prejudices in evaluations and perceptions. * **Benefits of Equality:** The passage emphasizes the numerous benefits of gender equality in leadership, including improved company performance, happier families, and stronger marriages.  * **Call to Action:** The article concludes by urging readers to challenge gender bias and support women's aspirations for leadership roles, emphasizing that achieving true equality requires acknowledging and actively dismantling these biases.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not know the exact reason Alexis Sanchez chose the Emirates Stadium over Anfield - but he is glad the Chile forward will be lining up for his side rather than against them for Liverpool on Saturday. Sanchez had his selection of clubs once Barcelona had decided to let him leave, and following the World Cup, the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under Wenger's expert guidance, going on to make an instant impression in English football. The French coach, however, admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards. Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal . Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (right) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club . 'At the end of the day, only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us. I don't know why he did that, but we are happy that he made that decision,' said Wenger of the £32million Chile forward, who has netted 19 goals so far. 'I was (aware of Liverpool's interest), but you never know if it is really true, but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez (from Barcelona). 'In the negotiations, yes, it is a strength - and it makes sense, an exchange and some money for Liverpool.' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around. 'If you look at the qualities, efficiency, work-rate, fighting spirit - (he is at the) top,' the Arsenal boss added. 'When it (the game) becomes flat, he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters.' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash, Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, who has so far rejected a new contract offer. Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish, Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge. 'He has done very well. I think he found a solution at the right time,' the Arsenal manager said. 'They did well last season too, they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League, which is absolutely fantastic.' Wenger has moved to play down speculation linking him with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling .",1.

"He is appealing against an appeal court ruling lifting a ban on him being named in the media in England and Wales. The Supreme Court said it will now hear arguments about whether it should grant an appeal, and if so, decide if it should be ""allowed or dismissed"". An interim injunction will remain in place until the end of the hearing. On Monday, Court of Appeal judges gave the man - who has young children, and whose spouse is also in the public eye - until 10:00 BST on Tuesday to apply to take the case to the UK Supreme Court. In that ruling, they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity's identity before 13:00 BST on Wednesday. The Supreme Court said that interim injunction will now remain in place until the conclusion of the next hearing. The Sun on Sunday wants to publish an account of alleged extra-marital activities by the man, who is referred to as PJS. But he argues he has a right to privacy and has taken legal action. Monday's court judgement said the celebrity had ""occasional sexual encounters"" with another person - referred to in court as AB - starting in 2009. They had a text message exchange in December 2011 in which they discussed a ""three-way"" with AB's partner, CD. Accordingly, the three met for a three-way sexual encounter. In January, the two other parties approached the Sun On Sunday with the story. That month a High Court judge refused to impose an injunction barring publication. But the man appealed and two appeal court judges ruled in his favour. They prevented him being identified in publications in England and Wales. Lawyers for News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun On Sunday - then asked Court of Appeal judges to lift the ban. They argued that stories had been published in the US, Scotland and elsewhere where the injunction does not apply. The story had also spread across the internet and on Twitter. PJS opposed that application and said the ban should stay. On Monday, the judges ruled that PJS was now unlikely to be able to get a permanent injunction Details about the allegations were now ""so widespread"" that confidentiality had ""probably been lost"", they said. The man's solicitors had been ""assiduous"" in monitoring the internet and removing stories in breach of the injunction but the judges said that it was now a ""hopeless task"".","1.

"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". ""In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","On January 20, 2017, four militants armed with guns and grenades attacked a hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan.

Scroll down for video . Last week she was barely showing – but Demelza Poldark is now the proud mother to the show’s latest addition . He may have married his red-headed kitchen maid out of duty, but as he tells her that she makes him a better man, audiences can have little doubt about his feelings.

With the climax of the previous episode being the announcement of the pregnancy, it is quite a jump to the start of tomorrow’s instalment where Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant. Just minutes after – once again without any nod to the passing of time – she is giving birth, with the last month of her pregnancy passing in less than the blink of an eye.

"Jak Trueman, 15, was suffering from a rare form of blood cancer called gamma delta T-cell lymphoma. On Saturday he briefly attended a school prom held in his honour. His mother Allison broke the news of his death on his Facebook page, saying: ""Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven."" She added: ""God bless. Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx."" The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media. Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd. The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond. The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell. On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell. Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson. The teenager wrote on his page: ""I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again. ""I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving. ""Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile."" At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity. The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months. He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked. Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school. On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment. At the time, Jak wrote: ""This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have. ""I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it. ""I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me."" In the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research. After becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike. More money is expected to be raised for charity on Sunday at a special football match being held at the Energy Assets Arena, home of Livingston FC.","Here's a concise summary of the passage:  Jak Trueman, a 15-year-old boy from West Calder, Scotland, passed away from a rare form of blood cancer called gamma delta T-cell lymphoma.

"After the League Two side's bright start, two quick goals from Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time. Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later. The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header. James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park.

"The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place. But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. ""Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,"" she said. ""We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. ""It would be more heartbreak than humiliation."" Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group.

""It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. ""I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead."" With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. ""Iceland are top seeds in the group,"" Evans noted. ""They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. ""But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them.

Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. ""It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,"" she recalled. ""There were thousands of people cheering when we came out.

Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. ""Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,"" she added. ""The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. ""Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition.
